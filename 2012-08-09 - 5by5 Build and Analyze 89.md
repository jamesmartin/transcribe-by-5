## Episode 89 - Giant Mushy Boat

Dan: This is episode number eighty nine, today is Monday August 6th, 2012. We have three lovely sponsors I'll tell you about as the show goes on, the first is [Flixel](http://flixel.com/), the second is [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com/5by5), and finally, and certainly not least, we have [Hover](http://hover.com/dansentme). We also want to mention the bandwidth for the entire month of August is sponsored by [Audiobooks App](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks/id311507490?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=GfpxbBXXpXE-y3gfJGyOQcSr2tOpkzD12A), where you can listen to thousands of your favorite books on your iPhone or your iPad for free; don't know how they do it.

Marco: Now I notice in this photo you sent me; are you in some kind of cubicle? What are those backing walls behind?

Dan: Those are my sound panels, propped up against the desk that I'm sitting in.

Marco: OK.

Dan: Can anyone in the chat room confirm that; how are our levels? Are we loud enough?

Marco: Are we level?

Dan: Are we level? Are we on the level?

Marco: Are we level enough for you?

Dan: Marco, are you on the level?

Marco: You know I recently started hearing the term "on the bubble" a lot. The first place I heard it was [Top Chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Chef). 

Dan: I want to sunset that term.

Marco: (laughs) Where did that come from? When did that start?

Dan: I don't know where it started?

Marco: Because on Top Chef I thought they just made it up, but then I started hearing it in a few other places.

Dan:  No, I don't know where it came from. The first time that I remember hearing about it is when; what's the lovely host of that show?

Marco: [Padma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Lakshmi)?

Dan: Padma. She says, "William, you're on the bubble". I never heard that before. It sounds like a sports term to me.

Marco: Maybe that's why we don't know.

Dan: I mean we hear about that when they talk about the playoffs.

Marco: Well you're kind of into sports.

Dan: Yeah, well NFL and a little bit of MLB.

Marco: The fact that you even call it that and not 'Football' and 'Baseball' means you're a lot more into sports than I am.

Dan: Yeah, for better or worse. I guess.

Dan: Is this the show? We've started I think.

Marco: We're going to take all of this out, right?

Dan: Yeah, we'll edit all this out.

Marco: Yeah, that can be the show. Were you recording all that?

Dan: Yeah, I record everything. l record from the minute I wake up.

Marco: Of course.

Dan:  To the end of the day.

Marco: Love the Truman Show; great movie.

Dan: Livin' it.

Marco: Yep. Alright, so, I guess we got some follow up from last week.

Dan: Oh, yeah.

Marco: Little bit. So; first of all, I stopped using my clicky keyboard, couple of days ago.

Dan: Yeah, you were experiencing some kind of trouble, some kind of...

Marco: Yeah, I started getting some wrist pain and I that's not something I want to mess with, at all.

Dan: No. That's no good at all.

Marco: That's like, generally speaking, if you are in this business, or in any business that requires you to use a computer most of the time, if you experience *any* kind of wrist pain or any potential signs of RSI, that is something to be taken extremely serriously and I suggest make a change immediately.

Dan:  Do you ice it?

Marco: No. I haven't really had much of a problem since... I very first started experiencing RSI-type symptoms in 2005; it was the year I got my first job after college and was really spending more time than usual in front of a computer. I quickly found a few things that worked for me and I haven't really had to make any changes since then. And so one of those things was getting this tremendous Microsoft Natural 4000 boat-keyboard, which I love a lot about this; what I don't love about this, and the reason I was looking at clicky keyboards at all, is the keys are ridiculously mushy and take a lot of pressure to push down and just have no feedback at all.

Dan: Right.

Marco: And, the keyboard is so incredibly wide because it has the whole ten key number pad on the right and the regularly sized arrow keys and insert/page-up kind of block, that the mouse has to be way over in New Jersey. The mouse is so far off to the right that it just is so far away that it's uncomfortable a lot of times to have to reach all the way over there and I have this giant wide desk arrangement; and it's actually better, ergonomically, if the mouse is relatively closer to you so you don't have to keep reaching over. 

Marco: So, that aside though, the shape of this keyboard is extremely comfortable, at least for me. And I've heard from a lot of people who say the same thing, basically that they've tried other keyboards and they keep coming back to this one because it is so comfortable and nothing else really has this angle, with the exception of, maybe, the highest end 'Kinesis' keyboard, which I believe is the Kinesis Advantage. The problem with that one, and I discussed this before so I'm not going to go too far into it, is that it moves all of the other keys, like the backspace and the enter and all that stuff; it moves it into new locations that you hit with your thumb; kind of in the middle. And that's a bigger learning curve than I'm willing to use right now, and that also makes me worry about switching to different keyboards in the future; about my ability to do that.

Marco:  So, I'm not quite on board with that. Kinesis are doing a new version of their 'Freestyle' keyboard, that looks like it might be able to approach the angle that the Microsoft Natural 4000 has, or at least be able to be customized into that angle. They're making a Mac version of that in November so I think I'm going to try that when it comes out.

Marco: But, otherwise I'm sticking with my giant mushy boat for the time being until someone comes up with anything better.

Marco: And honestly, this would the perfect thing for someone to make with Kickstarter. It requires some production, you could get some advance orders and get your costs down. I mean all these ergonomic keyboards cost like 130-140 bucks or more, and all the mechanical ones and everything. I think, if you could make a keyboard with any of these Cherry mechanical switches that everyone loves, like the Cherry browns, the Cherry blues are famous for being even louder and clickier. If you coul make an ergonomic with Cherry Brown switches for anything under 200 bucks, I think you could get a lot of nerds to buy it.

Marco: So, I wish somebody would make that. I actually would be too afraid to make it because of patents; because patents *support* innovation.

Dan: Just the idea of doing anything even remotely in that space, you would be too nervous.

Marco: I would. I can look around and I can see that it appears that nobody makes keyboards that are shaped anything like the Natural 4000. 

Dan: I used to use that same, whatever the predecessor was to the 4000.

Marco: The beige one?

Dan: Yeah, the beige one. I had that thing, probably starting in whenever those things came out, and I got it for the exact same reason as you: Because I was experiencing some of that and I thought it would help. And it did. And I also got it because I knew how to touch-type but I kept falling into bad habbits where instead of touch-typing the way you're supposed to, I would sometimes to just revert back into this crazy 'hunt and peck' thing that I'd done for years as a kid. And this eliminated both of those problems. I've never had problems since then, even though I just use the standard aluminum Apple keyboards now, and laptop keyboards. I haven't had a re-peat of either of those issues.

Marco: Specifically the problem I have with most traditional keyboards, including the Apple ones, and including my nice clicky Filco that I'm trying out here; and this is what the Natural replaces or fixes. The advantage is that, when you are reaching your hands towards the keyboard, if you lay your hands out the way you would reach for a keyboard, if you keep your wrists straight and you reach inwards towards the center. Your wrists are appoaching the center at an angle; almost a 90 degree angle if you put you fingers together in front of you. And so, for you to apply these two angled hands onto a straight keyboard, you have to bend your wrists, so that your hands turn outwards and straighten. And it's that angle - so notice that your elbows turn your hands inwards and then on your left hand your left wrist has to rotate your hand so your hand is pointed a little bit more to the left, so that it can straighten its fingers onto a straight row of keys. It's that angle, that I think causes a lot of problems for a lot of people, including myself. And laptops have this problem too, but I've never typed on a laptop keyboard so often and for so long or for full time use, where it's been a problem.

Marco: So, I like the 4000, not only because it has its giant shape that keeps your hands from having to go all the way to the middle but it has this nice angle and this nice contour and even this nice big squishy wrist-wrest, that I often use as an elbow-wrest when I'm reading things. And it's just a very comfortable keyboard in a lot of ways. It's also just a very mediocre keyboard and I wish it was better, or I wish someone would make a better version. But again, who knows if Microsoft has patented the certain shape of some of the things on here or anything related to this, then that's a very dangerous place to go so I don't want to go there; I also don't have time and I'm starting up my new secret project, which I haven't told you about yet. But I have a lot of things going on and none of them make time for me to make a new keyboard type. Not to mention that I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing when it comes to manufacturing a physical product. So, I'm definitely not the right person to do that but I wish somebody would.

Dan: How long did you use this thing before you started to experience the issue?

Marco: About two weeks.

Dan: Two weeks. Two weeks of like eight hours a day? Or...

Marco: Yeah, two weeks of full time use.

Dan: OK.

Marco: And it's unfortunate, because I really love a lot about that, I love the feedback of the key switches, I love how small it is without the giant ten key pad on the right and how close my mouse could be and everything. I don't think I can go back to using that full time, I might return it, I don't know yet.

Dan: Just chuck it out. You don't need that crap.

Marco: (laughs) I don't think I can go back to using it full time, probably ever again, but I'll see.

Marco: Anyway, moving on. Little bit of text editor follow-up: I still like Chocolat, I still have not looked up how to pronounce it properly, thank you for everybody who sent in the link that I didn't click to their website that tells you how to pronounce it properly.

Marco: Last episode, I complained that I couldn't find out how to open a document in a new window. About a day later, they issued an update that adds a menu item to do exactly that, which apparently it was possible to do it before but the menu makes it more obvious how to do it. I'm not going to take credit for that, but I'm very happy to see it there. Overall, Chocolat still feels like the least finished of all these new text editors, except Text Mate 2, which feels even less finished, but it still feels the least finished. There are a few performance issues I've run into, but so far I like it the best. I'm probably going to buy it; today's been the last day of my trial, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy it and keep using it. I don't think I'm going to buy Sublime Text 2 yet; I might reevaluate that in the future. Please stop recommending Emacs and Vim; I beg you. Please, I beg you. I'm not interested.

Dan: Why? You won't even give them a try? 

Marco: I'm not interested in Emacs or Vim. I used Vim for a while; I've never used Emacs full time. Please, email Dan.

Marco: Anyway. Moving on. Question from Kyle Diaz, or 'Dees', I don't know. He says, "I was inspired by the question of why Mac developers use text editors to write in and ask, 'Why do Mac developers love the terminal so freakin' much?'. As a designer who spends most of my time doing HTML and CSS, I find the command line to be an uncomfortable and disconcerting environment, where one can do massive damage with little or no warning or feedback. Yet most of the Mac developers I know live in the command line. In fact even when there's as GUI available" - I think that might have been a typo there - "most of the developers I know prefer to use the command line. What gives?". 

Marco: So.

Dan: (laughs) You say it with such passion: "What gives - question mark".

Marco: You know, the command line has a very high learning curve. It's the kind of skill that you build over a career. On windows it's a whole different story; the Windows command line is much less mature and changes more often. It isn't really a first-class environment. But OSX's Unix underpinnings; Unix is natively a command line environment; that is how many people experience it. Any kind of Linux set up especially any kind of server side Linux setup, you're using a lot of command line stuff, or only command line stuff. On my servers I don't even *have* a GUI environment installed; I wouldn't even know how to access one if I did. Please don't tell me how to pipe it.

Marco: Command line interaction is actually quite simple. I don't mean *easy*, I mean *simple*; there's a difference. It is very, very simple. But, Kyle's right that it's unforgiving and there certainly is a high learning curve. What is nice about it, and I'm sure all of you out there who use it know this already, and will email me about how badly I explained it. What's nice about it is that the Unix philosophy is for command line programs to do one thing well. To not be these giant feature laden GUI applications with toolbars all over the place, that have a million different features, to really basically just be a pipe. And this design of piping is really deeply ingrained in Unix usage and command line usage and whether you're piping from the terminal or back to the terminal, or you're interacting with the program, or you're piping it into a file, or piping the output into gzip so you can make a zipped version of whatever you're typing. This whole environment of simple tools to pipe things to different places to pipe things to different places is very powerful; you can make very nice combos that will save you a lot of time, potentially. And, with a GUI app, whatever features it has, that's kind of set in stone, at least until the next version or whatever, but if a GUI app doesn't have an option to do something or doesn't have a built in feature, there's not much you can do about that. In a command line environment, you're generally using more than one program to do things, and if one of theses programs doesn't have an option you can pipe its output to a different one, or you can swap in a different version of that program or an alternative to that program in the middle of that workflow and have it work mostly the same way. Or you can pipe something in, or out that you automated the creation of, or that you need in a different format. It's just a very flexible and powerful environment and it can really save you a ton of time. But, like many esoteric, difficult computer things, it does have a very high learning curve, and it's the kind of thing you learn over a career, not something you can learn in a weekend. But you can get the basics down relatively quickly.

Marco: Once you master it, it's a lot like... Designers, you've probably had to work with Regular Expressions at some point in your life, even if you're not a full time developer, you might if you're in this kind of world where you're nearby developers, you probably had to write, or read - I feel sorry for you if you had to read it - a Regular Expression at some point.

Dan: If you're not sure, if you hear a developer in the cube over, just screaming they're probably working with Regular Expressions.

Marco: Yes. He probably had to edit a Regular Expression...

Dan: That someone else wrote.

Marco: Yeah, or that he wrote more than 24 hours ago. And he cannot figure out what it's supposed to be doing and what all those crazy characters mean. But I think the command line is a bigger broader version of that. If you've used a Regular Expression but you haven't used the command line much, you can kind of get an idea what one of these simple piping setup tools might be, and the kind of power that has, and the kind of automation that has, well the command line is like a much broader version of that, like you can do so many crazy things, but it does take a learning curve, for sure.

Marco: I'm sorry for explaining that so badly, for anybody who knows better about this stuff. I mean, would you say that's roughly correct?

Dan: I think it's completely correct; you're being too hard on yourself.

Marco: I don't know. It's a hard thing to explain.

Dan: Eventually, if you're writing code, eventually you will have to write a Regular Expression. If you're running a web server, you'll eventually probably have to do something with Regular Expressions. And there's lots of cheat sheets online; you can go and paste your regular expression into it and it'll run it through and it'll test it, so you don't have to keep restarting Apache or Nginx to see if what you did is actually correct.

Marco: Right.

Dan:  Do you have one you like?

Marco: A webserver?

Dan: No, one of the online testing tools for it.

Marco: No.

Dan: No.

Marco: No, I just test in my apps.

Dan: You just test it right in the app.

Marco: Yeah. I don't actually write that many Regexs that are complex.

Dan: You just do 'em in your head; you're that good.

Marco: Right. But even though I like the command line, I still don't like Emacs and Vim as my regular text editors, so please don't recommend them.

Dan: That was the point of that.

Marco: Yes.

Marco: Got another question, unrelated, from Mark Bone. He says, "I greatly prefer the Chemex over the Aeropress; no comparisson eye-mo. I cannot get much coffee flavor out of the Aeropress; it is just too mild."

Marco: Now, this is a common problem with the Aeropress. That people who first get it have; where it doesn't taste like much, the coffee is, just as he said, too mild. Almost always this is the result of not using a fine enough grind.

Dan: I was going to say: It all comes down to the grind.

Marco: Exactly. So I suspect, maybe Mark is not using a burr grinder. Like if you have one of those traditional spinning-blade grinders, it's very hard to get a lot of fine particles out of that. And that's what you really need for the Aeropress; you need a consistent fine grind. I definitely recommend use a burr grinder. You can get one for 50, 60 bucks for a low end one. Use a burr grinder and set it on a pretty fine setting for the Aeropress. It should be almost as fine as good Espresso grinds. And to give you some idea of whether it's fine enough: When you're pushing the plunger down, when you're pushing the coffee out of the Aeropress into the cup, it shouldn't be *that* easy to push it down. Now, a couple of times I've pushed it down while it was on my coffee scale, like while the whole setup was on my scale, to see how much pressure I'm using, and it was more than my scale could measure, and my scale caps out at 15 pounds. But it would occasionally measure 8 to 10 if I was pushing gently, so I could say roughly it takes maybe 10 to 15 pounds of pressure to push my Aeropress plunger down most of the time.

Dan: Is that clocked?

Marco: Clocked? No.

Dan: I mean, can you be sure?

Marco: No, I can't. That's why I said roughly. 

Dan: OK.

Marco: It shouldn't just fall down quickly when you push down on it. It should take a good 15 seconds minimum, if you're pushing as hard as you can. Maybe 10 seconds, if you push as hard as you can, but you're supposed to push a little more gently. It shouldn't be *that* fast.

Marco: If you can't get the grind any finer and you're still having weak coffee and the plunger is still too easy to push down. If you just don't have a good grinder and you can't get a better one, or you don't want to get a better one yet for whatever reason, then I suggest you use the inverted method. Which is basically, you make the Aeropress; you set it up upside down, with the plunger already in it and, you stretch the plunger all the way out so it's near the 4 line and so you have this big upside down Aeropress, you put the grinds in, leave the cap off, and you poor things in through the top, which is the bottom - you know, you'll see - anyway look up on Youtube videos of the inverted Aeropress method, it's a lot easier to visualize there. But it's basically a way for you to keep the water in the Aeropress as long as you'd like because it doesn't fall out the filter in the bottom while it's brewing. Then, when you're done you put the cap on, you flip it over and you put it into a cup.

Marco: If you have too coarse of a grind, or you're in some situation where you can't get a fine grind, do the inverted method and just let it brew for two or three minutes. Let it brew for a long time. Basically you're making it into a French press that's easier to clean. So, if you can't have the full Aeropress experience of the super-fine grind and pushing down hard on the plunger and getting some pressure in there then definitely make it like a French press.

Marco: OK. Moving on. You want to talk about this 'Metro-style' thing?

Dan: Oh, Yeah. That's a good one. Let's do our first sponsor, and then we'll jump on that. That's a great one.

Dan: Welcome to Hover: hover.com.

Marco: Thank you.

Dan: You're welcome. That's what they tell you when you go there. And let me tell you a little bit about Hover. Simplified domain management. You want to get yourself a great domain name, you go there. You type it into the search box; whatever dot com, whatever dot net, whatever it is you want. And if it's available, there's a little plus box, you hit the plus and it's yours. 

Dan: And that's it; and then they don't bother you. They don't sign you up for 150 million different things that, you don't know what they are, you don't want them, there's one checkbox, Marco, that you might have to think about when you're in there, and that is whether you want to use their free 'Whois' privacy thing. Do want your information going public? Sure, then uncheck it, it's checked by default but it doesn't cost anything extra. 

Dan: And that's it. They don't sign you up for stuff, they don't spam you with for stuff. The only time you're going to hear from these guys, ever, is "Oh, your domain name is about to expire, do you want to rewew it?", and that's it. That's *it*. They base their entire philosophy on providing a simple, clean, honest, straightforward experience. Things get out of you way. 

Dan: And that's it; you just go and register a domain. Now, if the domain you wanted is taken, they'll even show you some alternatives. Maybe there's some TLDs you didn't think of, maybe they'll come up with some other domain names based on some of the terms you typed in. Try it out. 

Dan: We all have a problem with domains, I think. Maybe you're not as bad as I am with compulsively registering domain names and I know I'm not as bad as Merlin. But all I'm saying is this: The next time you want to register a domain name; try it at Hover. You go to hover.com/dansentme and you'll get 10% off if you do that. You'll also support the show, because they'll know that you came from here. So try it out, hover.com/dansentme. Get a domain, and you won't be bothered.

Dan: Thanks very much to those guys, they've been great supporters of the show. Check 'em out: Hover.

Dan: Metro style. Metro *style*.

Marco: You mean Windows 8 style.

Dan: Windows 8 *style*.

Dan: Windows 8 user interface revision 2 *style*. Doesn't sound as good.

Marco: So what happened here, exactly? Do you have a good quick summary of it?

Dan: The quick summary that *I'm* familiar with, is essentially, Microsoft has announced - I found a good link for it that I'll put into the [show notes](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89) if I can find it - but here it is, this is an article by Peter Bright - friend of the show? I don't know - over at Ars Technica and he says, "Microsoft has been using the Metro name to describe the new geometric typography-heavy look and feel that is central to Windows 8 and is spreading across the company's entire range of products. Now sources are saying that all of a sudden it's going to be done. The legal and corporate affairs team sent out a memo *banning* the word 'Metro' because apparently it is a trademark held by a German retailer - Metro AG", seems like they would have found that out.

Marco: It does seem like, why was this coming out so late in the process? But anyway...

Dan:  "Microsoft spokesman told Ars Technica", quote, "'We have used Metro-style as a codename during the product development cycle across many of our product lines. As we get closer to launch and transition from industry dialogue to a broad consumer dialogue, we will use our commercial names."

Dan: So the interpretation of that is Microsoft saying, "(laughs) No, no no. We've been planning on calling it Windows 8 *all along*, this is just a codename; don't be silly. Why would you think we would use Metro? I mean, it's 'Windows 8 style UI'. Of course.".

Dan: What do you make of this? What do you think the deal is.

Marco: Oh, man. They have no balls.

Dan: It's that simple.

Marco: (laughs) OK. Apple's had it's share of trademark issues: iPhone was a trademark of Cisco before the iPhone was announced and Apple basically said, "Our product should be called this".

Dan: "We're just going to do it anyway".

Marco: We're just going to do what it takes. We're just going to do it.

Dan: Sure. Yeah.

Marco: Easy as that. We're not going to back down. We'll just license it from Cisco or just buy it from them. If they won't deal with us, we'll just wait for them to sue us and we'll settle there. It's about having balls. When you have a product that you're so confident in that this is the right name for, and it seems remotely possible that you could possibly get it or use it; just use it. Microsoft though, to quote Steve Jobs, has no taste. This is a side effect of a bigger problem, which is that Microsoft believes way too much in the Windows brand. And we've talked about this a little bit before; that should really become like a bingo-spot on this show. For the 5by5 bingo, whatever that is.

Dan: Oh, Yeah, that thing.

Marco: I always say, we talked about this before, so I'm not going to go too far into it, but...

Dan: And then we spend an hour talking about it.

Marco: Right. Exactly. The same eight topics.

Dan: Every week. Consistency.

Marco: Metro was a nice name. The whole Metro environment, and I'm still going to call it that for a while. The whole Metro environment is daring. It's a bold move by Microsoft that they are really for the first time ever, throwing away a whole lot of Windows legacy stuff. Maybe not the APIs as much, but they're throwing away the interface, they're throwing away the look and the feel of Windows. Largely in favor of this new environment. It's a very bold move and it really shows that maybe things are turning around for Microsoft. Because they've been so complacent since Bill Gates left the company, or left his role there. Mysteriously Steve Ballmer still has his job. But they really haven't done anything, during that time. They've left everything the same and just keep the ship going in a straight line. And this is one of the first major departures they've had in the last decade and certainly the first one to happen to Windows in - possibly forever.

Marco: So. And, more importantly, it seems in many ways to be good. And I think the Metro style has a lot of problems, honestly, but it's well receieved and I do give them credit for trying. It is new, it is unique, it is modern looking. Android has always just looked like an iOS rip-off in so many ways. I do give Microsoft credit for making something different; it really is different. Even WebOS did not look different. Android was like a bad copy of iOS, WebOS in many ways was like a good copy of iOS. It was still a copy. And certainly, I'm not saying that everything was copied, but certainly a lot of it was. What's interesting about Windows 8 is that they really made some kind of effort to do something differently and uniquely, which from Microsoft - tell anybody in the 90s that this would be Microsoft's future and they would think you were crazy, that Microsoft would be the one innovating and that Google would be the copycat. That would have been very strange to hear in 1999. It's really great that they did all of this but now they're just weasling out of this term beacuse the want to avoid what would probably be a fairly small legal challenge.

Marco: They can call it whatever they want. It just shows a weird lack of a spine and that's just so Microsoft-y: "We'll just throw away that". If they're going to compromise on that, what else do they compromise on and who else are they going to bend to when things become a little bit uncomfortable, because, what they're about to do, by the way, is they're about to launch a whole new, completely revamped OS into an extremely conservative consumer market, of people who buy Windows PCs and don't want anything to change ever. And they're about to launch a big change in to *that*.

Marco: So, if they backed down so easily with the name, when there was what seemed like a very small challenge to the name, if they backed down so easy about that, what else are they going to back down with. Are they going to launch this new version of Windows that kind of relegates the old desktop to this weird little side show? When people say they don't like that anymore, are they going to throw in an option in a point one release to have the old desktop back as a default view and hide Metro away? Is that something that every company is just going to disable?

Marco: It just shows a lack a spine.

Dan: I think that's exactly what's going to happen. I remember when Windows XP first came out there was an option in there, display preferences or whatever, and you could pick, to have it look basically like the old Windows again.

Marco:  And I did that on day one.

Dan: Instantaneously.

Marco:  As soon as you install it.

Dan: Yeah, like it's installed. Step one: make it look the way I want it to look again that makes sense.

Marco: Yeah. Get rid of all this new stuff. Make it look the old way.

Dan:  And everyone did that. Everybody did that.

Marco: And part of that was because the Windows XP UI skin sucked.

Dan:  It was horrible. It was so horrible.

Marco: It was just garish.

Dan: (reading)  "Metro AG is a diversified retail and wholesale cash and carry group, based in Dusseldorf, Germany. It has the largest market share in its home market and its one of the globalized retail and wholesale corporations, the fifth largest retailer in the world, measured by revenues, after Walmart, Carefort, Tesco and Kroger. In English it often refers to itself as Metro Group and it was established in 1964.".

Marco:  You know it wouldn't suprise me, because you know it sounds like that would be a fairly easy trademark dispute to resolve, because it's not like Google is calling their next thing 'Metro'. This is a whole different industry and a whole different brand. And Metro is not even - Microsoft was always very careful to say 'Metro style', even. And that , I think weakens the trademark claim even further that they weren't saying "This is Metro", they were describing a part of Windows 8 as 'Metro style'. It just seems like this was a really easy dispute to resolve and they just chose, "well we just give up", and that's it. 

Marco: You know I wonder if because they're so weird about their Windows branding, and chucking that all over the place, there was an argument internally at Microsoft, I'm sure that itself is fairly plausible, between calling it 'Windows 8 Style' and calling it this new name. And maybe this one little legal threat was enough to make the Windows people say, "Uh, I told you so, we gotta switch back", and took the argument in the other direction. Do you think? Maybe that's what happened.

Dan: I think that's a good theory.

Marco: Sounds plausible, right?

Dan: Very.

Marco: Oh, man.

Dan:  Just to give you and idea - because we're all software geeks, and we're all computer geeks - just to give you an idea of how big the Metro Group is compared to Microsoft, OK, these are going to be their 2010 numbers, I don't know how they're doing in 2012, but this is what Wikipedia - master of all information, and we know is correct - their revenue was 67.26 billion in 2010.

Marco:  Billion?

Dan: Yes.

Marco: Wow.

Dan: The Microsoft Wikipedia entry for 2012; they did 73.2 billion in revenue. So, this is almost the same size company, really.

Marco: Wow, that's interesting; I didn't realise it was that big.

Dan: Yeah. And profit, for the Metro guys was 850 million and profit for Microsoft, again  we're not comparing the same year, so it might not be totally fair, but let's see, actually they're not showing the profit for this year. But consider that their operating income was 21.76 billion. Net income 16.97 billion, so there you go. Seems like Microsoft could have stood toe to toe with these guys, right?

Marco: I mean, well, whether it was worth it or not is a different story.

Dan: I think you're right, I think the lawyers just were like, "Ooh, good. We can go back to using Windows for everything.".

Marco: Yeah. OK, I mean that company is bigger than I thought it would be, however, I do think that because these are such different industries, I think it would have been a fairly easy trademark dispute to resolve. And maybe Microsoft would have had to pay some small token fee to licence it, I don't know. It just seemed like they backed off so easily and gave up this fairly good name, for this new system, and applied this really ancient, weak, spineless name; "Windows 8 style", by the cult of Microsoft that thinks that Windows has a strong brand.

Marco: Anyway, I'm guessing we're going to see some relatively soon update to Windows. Whether it's Windows 9 or Windows 8.1, that gives people the option to get rid of Metro for the most part and make the desktop the default, but we'll see. 

Dan: I think you're spot on.

Marco: We've seen from modern day Microsoft, we've seen that they can have good ideas and they can have good initiatives. Windows Phone, I think, is a good example. Windows Phone 7 was very well received by critics, but almost everybody said, "this is almost great, it's on the way to being great, I can't wait to see how they follow through with this". And then they didn't follow through with it, or they followed through very badly. And I can't help but wonder if that same thing will happen to Windows 8, it hasn't come out yet, we haven't seen what they're going to do with it, but a lot about Windows 8 is people saying, "this looks like it can be really good, I hope it *is* really good", or, "I hope it *becomes* really good", or "this could really grow into something great". It's all the same things that people were saying about Windows Phone 7 and that kind of fizzled out because even though Microsoft employs a lot of very smart people and they have a lot of good initiatives, they still seem to lack the follow through in a lot of these cases. So, I wouldn't say it's a guaranteed hit here, and I wouldn't say this is a guaranteed success and so, when they show signs of weakness like this naming thing - admitedly, the name is not than important, but it does show this weird sign of weakness that maybe they don't have the conviction internally to say, "well we think what we're doing here is a good idea here". And without that conviction it's a lot easier to just go back to the way you used to do things.

Dan: Well, you know, it's decision by comittee and that's what Microsoft has always been about and any time it seems like they're going to come out with something great, it almost seems like whatever happens behind the scenes, it sabotages it. They say, "Oh, we've got this cool thing, we're going to call it Metro it's really great, it's totally different", and then, "Oh, well, there's some company, in Germany, so we'd better just call it Windows and we'd better make it optional and we'll just stay where we've been. We're pretty good. We're alright just where we are.". That innovation, it's optional.

Marco: Exactly. And we know from the outside and from the inside; we know that Microsoft has always had a lot of infighting and it's always been a big problem for them. So, anyway, I'm a little scared about their follow through here, that's all.

Marco: Anyway, want to move on? I do want to talk about Hulu Plus a little bit, because it came to the Apple TV. I know that this is a little outside the realm of this show, if anything is.

Dan: Really? Coffee, that's on the docket. But, no, we can't talk about Apple TV. Not here.

Marco:  No. Well we can't develop for it yet.

Dan: That's right. We'll do our second sponsor and then we can jump right to that. Our second sponsor today is Flixel. This is a free iPhone app that lets you create what they call living photos. What is a living photo?

Marco: I believe Kevin and Jamie call them cinemagraphs, right?

Dan: I believe you may be right. It is unlike a still photo. A living photo has a portion of seemless and infinitely looping motion. Like you can imagine something you might see. What is that website that does this, with movies from Stanley Kubrick and other things like that? Do you know the one I'm talking about? Maybe the chat room knows. We'll put it in the [show notes](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89].

Marco: Yeah, I think it's on Tumblr.

Dan: It is a Tumblr. 

Marco: Well this whole thing started on Tumblr by Kevin and Jamie and you have all the links in there to their stuff. They started this art form. It's basically a photo, turned into an animated gif with very small portion of the photo animated. So, like one of the first ones I saw, was like, it was like a woman standing on a balcony and her hair was blowing in the wind. Nothing else was moving. And it's a really cool effect, it looks really nice. In the past it's been extremely difficult to create, because they were just creating these things, basically manually. Like rendering each frame, like taking the photos and rendering each frame. So this tool, now, lets you automate that, right?

Dan: Yeah, exactly. I have some links set up here in the [show notes](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89). By the way you can go to the show notes by going to [5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89) that's this episode, and I have some links for this showing in there. But, yeah, that's exactly what this is. So you can imagine something just repeating. It might be somebody looking at the camera who just every few seconds they just blink, and it's, anyway, yes, that's exactly what this is. And it's super easy to use. You do this all with your phone. You hold your iPhone really steady, like this, watch, then you capture 2 seconds, and then you use your finger to paint the area that you want to animate and that's it. Now you've got to be steady, but if you weren't steady enough, they have a little paint bucket tool that just animates the whole scene. And it is really, really cool, I mean, like it's really cool if you like this style thing, I think this is just going to help this whole thing just explode and remember, it's free. So there's no reason you shouldn't just go and try it. It's [Flixel](http://flixel.com), f-l-i-x-e-l, dot com. There's a video link there. They have a cool music video made entirely out of living photos that they have created with the app. It's the coolest thing. So go check it out, [Flixel](http://flixel.com), f-l-i-x-e-l, dot com. It's a lot of fun.

Marco:  Now, Hulu Plus.

Dan: Hulu Plus.

Marco: Now I got to say, as we've talked about before, I'm not a TV subscriber. I don't have cable, I don't watch broadcast TV, but we *do* watch TV shows and we usually just get them from iTunes or Netflix. And, so, this has been our setup for 5 or 6 years now. So, Hulu is now on the Apple TV, and for a brief few minutes, Tiff and I - well at least I was - very excited about the possibilty of this, because I thought, there's a lot of shows I *can't* get on iTunes and Netflix that I would like to watch. And so, if I can get them from Hulu that's tempting, I'd love to try that out.

Marco: Apparently, though, Hulu is, I guess it's successful, or it's tempting for people who are acustomed to TV as the alternative, you know like the whole commercial deal. But for somebody like me, who, I don't ever really see commercials, and I'm not really accustomed to severe restrictions on availability. In the places I get them, either it's available or it's not. I might have to wait a year for a season of a show to become available, but once it's there, it generally stays there. Or, in the case of iTunes, if I buy these TV shows, they're mine. I don't own them, but I have a license to view them under certain restrictions, forever effectively, or until Apple goes out of business or changes their terms or whatever. So, Hulu, I don't know a lot about it, and I should preface all that by saying that again; I really don't know a lot about Hulu. But I looked at what Hulu Plus got me and we tried it briefly and it just seems like it's a terrible deal. Is that just me? It seems like what it gets you is some shows, some episodes of those shows, within a weird time window of like 1 and 4 months old, or something. And it still has commercials in it. And you pay for that. Is that roughly correct? Do you use it?

Dan: I have used it. I have not used the Pro service very much. I have used the regular service. And I usually would use the regular services when I would miss a show that I wanted to see and then something terrible happened where it wasn't recorded by the DVR. That was what; it saved me a couple of times. It was like, oh man, how am I ever going to see this? We missed this episode we really wanted to see and we were able to see it there. I think that happened a couple of times with Lost. And that's really the only time I've used it actively and I think I used it a little bit when I had a Mac Mini that was running Boxee for a little while, so I had it on there. And I think that that's it, I think those were the only times that I've actually really used it and I had been planning to try what you're trying; try it on the Apple TV, but we had family in town and I'm trying this different thing. It's a mess. So I was really hoping that you would be able to give a full report. Is it not just convenient? Does it not give you anything? Is there no value to it?

Marco: So, whenever I've tried it, I've always  hit some kind of weird restriction with what I wanted to watch, either it wasn't available or only half a season would be available. Or it would have the first part of the season, but not until two weeks after it aired on TV or something weird like that. And then I'd still be seeing all these ads in it, so it just really wasn't that compelling of an option for me. There wasn't anything there that I wanted to watch so badly that I would pay for it, and see commercials and be subject to their restrictions. Because a lot of the stuff on Hulu you can't even watch on TV yet, because they don't have licensing to show it on TV. So even some things that you can watch with Hulu Plus in your browser, you can't watch on your TV without doing AirPlay, or some other hack like that. Well, the Mac Mini could do it but the Apple TV can't do it, Boxee has always got in trouble with them for trying to cross that border. It's just so weird. It's like they've brought over as much pain as possible from the content owners. Which makes sense, because Hulu, I beleieve, was started by a few of the content owners, right? Wasn't it some kind of joint effort between NBC and Fox, or something like that?

Dan: Yeah.

Marco: Something like that. So, it just is not compelling for me. So, anyway, that's why I was disappointed with it. I was hoping it would help the so-called cord cutters, but I don't think it does. Or it helps very little. And I think that if you're going to pay for Hulu, I'm sure it doesn't disappoint everybody, but it really disappointed me.

Dan: Maybe now I don't even need to get it. I don't even need to waste any time now. You've done it. You've vetted it. Now we can all move on.

Marco: I don't know. If what you want to watch is available there in some good compelling way, then go for it. Just, what I wanted to watch wasn't.

Dan: Jen Simmons, she does a show - she used to do The Daily Edition with me and she does a show here called The Web Ahead. She's lurking around in the chat room and I know she's like famously, she's cut her cable, she actually physically removed TVs from here house. That's history. So Jen, if you're listening to this, can you just summarize in a sentence what it is you do with this? Why do you? She says in the chatroom that she's paid for Hulu Plus for years. So maybe, we'll let her type it up.

Marco: Alright.

Dan: But you're saying, don't even bother.

Marco: My recommendation to others is, feel free to check it out, try it out if you think it might help you, it just didn't help me at all.

Dan: Doesn't it get you closer though, Marco, to the Holy Grail, which is being able to watch shows very close to, or at the same time almost as you could if you had regular TV? Because that's the thing that I want. We don't watch that much regular TV at all. We do watch some of it. And I would love to be able to get those programs - and forget the whole HBO discussion that we've had a million times - forget those. I'm just talking about Network TV. I think it would be really cool to be able to watch a football game - and forget sports, fine, because they could come out with an app for that, the MLB did - but let's just say regular old TV. I would like to watch... Let's just say I want to watch Letterman, on CBS, when it comes out. I would love to be able to do that on the Apple TV and I could cut cable and I wouldn't have to screw around with an antenna on my roof.

Marco: What we want doesn't really exist. It's not like we want to cut cable and still watch what's on cable. That's not the case at all. What we want is to cut cable and then to just be able to have the shows, with no commercials and everything. That, legally, usually doesn't exist. Or it exists in fairly uncompelling ways, like waiting forever for them to come out on DVD and then having Netflix give them to you, or paying what sometimes seems too much for an iTunes season pass for a show. We have options for that, sometimes, for a lot of shows and a lot of networks those aren't options; you don't even have those options. And I think what we want - speaking for this whole class of people that it's probably not fair to generalise - I think what we want is all of the shows that are available with most cable subscriptions, available for purchase and streaming with no commercials, the way we want them. I wouldn't say it's *never* going to happen, but I think it's a *very* long way off.

Dan: Do you feel? Maybe you don't feel this way, but do you suspect that a lot of people feel that if they're paying for it that it should not have commercials? Is that a big issue? What if I told you that the commercials were gone? Would you like it a little bit better?

Marco: Yeah. That is an issue for me. I don't think it's an issue for most people. Because, you pay for cable and you have commercials there. People pay for newspaper subscriptions, and they're full of ads. You can look a that and say that there's a lot of examples in the world where paid products still have advertising and people seem OK with it. Or at least they tolerate it. And, you know, with Hulu, it just seems like... I feel like, once you've moved into this world... It's not that nobody will tolerate, or everybody will tolerate ads with paid content. It's that once you've moved into this world that I'm in - that I think that you're probably mostly in, if not completely in as well, and I bet a lot of listeners are in - this world of not really seeing a lot of commercials, and not paying for a lot of content that includes ads; once you've crossed that line, it becomes more annoying when you *do* have ads in something you've paid for. There was that whole deal with Parallels that people got upset about. I don't know the details, so I can't really talk about it, but - well not like it's ever stopped me before - you know, I don't know where people's tolerances are, I just know where my tolerance is, and that once I stopped paying for things that had ads in them as much as I possibly could, my tolerance for that got much lower. So, when I would see it, it would really impact me. And it also doesn't help, by the way, that the ads in Hulu, and most of the TV broadcast networks have websites where you can use their Flash player, and they'll put ads in that too. The problem with most of these ads, is that they're badly sold, so that you'll see the same ad six times in an hour. Or, sometimes you'll even see it twice in a row, in one commercial break, you'll see the same two ads repeated twice each, because they aren't even selling this inventory very well. Or they're just really terribly targeted - untargeted - ads that are just even more irritating to see because they're so untargeted. So it isn't just that these ads are there; but that they're *bad ads*, they're annoying ads. Nobody wants to see the same commercial twice in a row; it looks like a mistake, it looks nobody's at the wheel and I think that's actually the case in a lot of these instances. And it just seems bad. 

Marco: Again, once you've moved out of that crappy world, your standards are inherently raised by how good the non-commercial filled world really is. And when you go back it's kind of jarring how bad that was and how you tolerated that for so long. At least for me. I guess I can't really generalize.

Dan: Everybody listening; everybody in our audience right now, Marco, and you and me. We all want exactly the same thing: We want to be able to say, "this is the TV show I would like to watch. I would like to watch it as soon as it's available and I'm willing to pay for that. And give it to me with no commercials.". And we all have money and our money is out in our hands and we're saying, "who do I give this money to, to make this happen.". The networks certainly don't want to do it. Apple *can't* make it happen. I think Apple would love to be the middle man, but they can't.

Marco: Yeah, they're trying.

Dan: Yeah, they really are trying. It's not going to be Hulu. It's not going to be Netflix. Or maybe it's not the companies the way we know them today. Maybe in five years, maybe in fifteen years. But *this is what we want; It's very simple*. 

Dan: "Oh, you want to watch Fringe? Great.". Let me buy a season of Fringe. I'll pay you whatever you want for it, if it's reasonable. And whatever day that comes out, if it's Friday night at 9PM, whatever it is, that's when I want to be able to sit down and watch it. And maybe I won't watch it then, maybe I'll watch it at my own convenience, but give it to me, let me buy what I want and give it to me with no commercials.

Marco: I mean, part of the problem, though, is - you just said - you know, whatever you want to charge, reasonable price, I'll pay it. The problem is, as we discussed in a few other shows; a lot of times, advertisers are willing to pay so much, that customers are not willing to match that or to exceed that. So in a lot of cases, if NBC can figure out what an episode of - what shows are on NBC? Friends is gone? Seinfeld is gone? OK, how about a Seinfeld rerun? If NBC can figure out how much they get for every Seinfeld rerun, I'm sure this is a number in some spreadsheet somewhere, then they can calculate, "OK, if we're going to sell this ad-free to you, on iTunes, we are potentially losing say 3 or 4 Dollars worth of ad revenue there". Well, if we're not willing to spend 3 or 4 Dollars on that episode, then they're just not going to make that choice. They're not going to make that available to us.

Dan: George in the chat room says, reminds us that John Siracusa has essentially said that the advertisers are just out bidding us.

Marco: Yes. Yeah, that whole point starts with John Siracusa. I want to give him credit, otherwise I'll get lots of email and he will be upset. 

 Marco: If that's really happening a lot in TV, and I think it still is - a lot - for the most part, then you can't really blame the content creators. It's not that the content creators are being stupid idiots here. Sometimes they're a little bit slow to get onto new technology, but for the most part, it comes down to business, it comes down to money, and if they are still making tons of money doing things the old way, then you can't blame then for sticking with it. And so the problem is not the networks being stupid, the problem is people. And there's not that much you can do about that apart from vote with your own dollars and your own wallet. But if everyone else isn't voting the same way, you can't blame the networks for doing what they do.
 
 Marco:  What you can do, is get your own podcast and start telling people how awesome it is in this other place. And if they just come over here, and they can just get enough people to come over to this new way of watching and paying for things, it actually is a lot nicer, but unfortunately, it's like being a conoisseur of something; you're never going to convince the masses, it's always going to be a little bit sad for you and you'll just have to deal with it.
 
 Marco: You want to take a sponsor break?
 
 Dan: Yeah, alright. We'll do our last sponsor; it's [squarespace dot com](http://squarespace.com). These guys are great. It's everything you need to make an amazing website. You can make a blog, you can make a wonderful photo gallery, whatever it is you want to do. You want to make just a real straightforward website, for your company, for your business, for you iOS app. You want to run a podcast; you can do that. They've got it all. They're fully hosted, completely managed, you don't have to do anything. So no matter how experienced you are making websites, you can build something that is amazing and you can do it really, really fast. And you don't have to worry about hosting or scaling or integrating with services, especially the ones that you're already using: Twitter, Facebook. You know, I run [Big Week dot C O](http://bigweek.co) and that's where I post news. And whenever I have something that I think the Twitter followers would be intersted in, I just toggle the little thing that says, "Oh, you want to post this to Twitter?", and it Tweets it for me. I don't know it does it - I mean, I do, because 5by5 does it and I wrote the code to do it, so I know how they do it - but it just works. You don't have to think about it; you just give it access, it authorizes it through Twitter; done. Same thing for Facebook; done.
 
 Dan: They've got these amazing new templates. And they really are. The focus is on the content, and you can go and check this out over at [squarespace dot com](http://squarespace.com), you can learn what they do. They've got a great new layout engine, they've got really cool page builders over there. All of this stuff. *And* there's 24 - 7 support. So you could be working on this in the middle of the night, something isn't working the way you want it, and they have a human being, that understands their software, who can look at your site, who can tell you what you're doing wrong, who can help you with it. Real human beings. And it's really great.
 
 Dan: If you sign up for a year, you get a free domain name of your choice. If you just want to pay month-to-month, no big deal. You can still link a custom domain name that's yours if you want. Or you can just use one of theirs. And you get a trial.
 
 Dan: It's 10 bucks a month for the standard plan. It's 20 bucks a month for the unlimited plan and you get 20% off if you sign up for a year or 25% off if you sign up for two years. And if you just want to try it out, you use my code. Well actually you can use my code, combined with any of these and you'll get an additional 10% off: *DANSENTME8*, because this is the eigth month, Marco, so *DANSENTME8*. And that will get you 10% off anything you want.
 
 Dan: So go check it out: [squarespace dot com](http://squarespace.com). Or [squarespace dot com slash 5by5](http://squarespace.com/5by5), even better. 
 
 Marco: *Much* better.
 
Marco: Alright. I got a question from Michael Festler who's question we answered a few weeks ago.

Dan: *Festler!* Miss that guy.

Marco: Well now you wont have to, because he's back.

Dan: Is that *M* Festler?

Marco: I don't know. He says, "I have hit Instapaper rate limits four to five times in the last two weeks. Usually when Instapapering Reeder feeds in a batch at one sitting.".

Dan: Now wait a minute. Rate limits: That means that he's posting, to read later, more articles than you are allowing.

Marco: Right.

Dan: You're pretty stingy though; you only allow like five or six a day, right?

Marco: I'll get to that.

Dan: OK.

Marco: "It is very frustrating, especially since the limit doesn't reset until the next day. My usage hasn't changed in quite a while, but your support guy's email said the limits have been tightened recently. Rate limits aren't documented anywhere on your site, except for a brief reference in developer API docs. Could you say something about why you impose rate limits, why you've tightened them up recently, why you're doing a full lock out until the next day and whether you've considered other ways to control server traffic that don't make Instapaper users twitchy about accidentally incurring a day-long Instapaper blackout with no advance warning. To be clear, I get that I can still read saved items, but being unable to save new ones for a day is suprisingly disruptive.".

Marco: Alright, so. I did, about two weeks ago, as he noted, add a rate limit to 'adding things to read later'. And there were a few reasons for this. One of the biggest ones was that there's a number of services cropping up out there, even though I forbid them in the API documentation, services that will basically pipe RSS feeds into your Instapaper account automatically. And what this results in, much more often than not, is people having thousands and thousands of unread items building up fairly quickly. And that pretty much ruins an Instapaper account for any real use. When you have thousands of articles being automatically added, you're never going to read anywhere close to all of those. And I don't mean for everybody to read everything they save, I don't even read everything I save; not even close, but, when you can very quickly build up ten thousand unread items, not only is the service not really meant for that and it's very expensive for me to keep hosting, but it's just bad for you, the user. Preventing that kind of build up, is important for the service to do, just to keep users from shooting themselves in the foot too bad. The service is not designed for that, it won't work well with that. The app certainly won't work well with that and it's just a waste. It's a waste for everybody.

Marco: So, I don't want... In my API documentation I specify, that for you app to add something to your read later list it should be caused by some kind of explicit action the user has taken about *that item*. And I specifically cite these kind of RSS feed translators as not permitted and not what I have in mind here. So, if it's something like, automatically send everything I star on Twitter to Instapaper, that's permitted, because the starring on Twitter is an explicit action that the user has taken somewhere, it doesn't have to be in Instapaper but it's an action they took somewhere to say, this means something to me; this particular item I've seen it; it means something to me; do something with it. As opposed to, all these RSS feeds have been posting items without me knowledge even, do something automatically with everything that comes in. And that's a weird distinction to make, but I think it makes all the difference here.

Marco: So, I've also started doing things that are more expensive with each bookmark saved. I'm running some stats on them, I have to index them for search if you're a subscriber and things like that. But the biggest thing is that I have to host these in a database. And even if I'm only saving the URL and the title and a couple of small meta data things, that adds up quickly; my database is over 250GB now. And when you have to host a large database on fast, always available hardware, it has to be replicated, it has to be backed up, usually in numerous places. I even have a new machine now that is soley dedicated to testing the backups, where it downloads them off my remote backup servers periodically and installs them, and tests them and runs some integrity tests on the database and makes sure it's all right. Database storage is by far the most expensive storage I have. And, it just gets unweildy after a while. One difference, for instance, a couple of years ago I had to move off of SSD storage for my database because at the time SSDs for servers didn't exist that were big enough to host my database in a 2U server on SSDs. Nowadays I probably could; it would be a lot of money, but I could. I would like to move back to an all SSD database because SSDs are getting bigger, that are suitable for servers, faster than my database is growing, so probably in the next year I'll be able to switch back to that. And when I was on SSDs for the database, it was so ridiculously fast; it was insanely fast, all the tim. I would love to move back to that. I could also probably save some money by having fewer read slaves.

Marco: Anyway, so I'm almost there. All that is to say, accounts that have tons and tons, you know thousands and thousands of unread articles building up, don't do anybody any good. And so I prohibit them, by API use, and I try to discourage people from having that kind of build up. So I have to have *a* rate limit. The old rate limit didn't apply to adding the things, it applied to overall hitting the service. And the old rate limit is still in place; I don't know what it is off hand. You have to make probably multiple requests per second, averaged over a long time to really hit it. But if you're adding a whole bunch of stuff, you can still add thousands of things per day under that limit. So, I have a separate rate limit that applies only to adding things. And currently - I don't want to guarantee this, and I actually instructed my support guy not to tell people what it is, but I'll tell you what it is here - I don't want to guarantee this because I don't want to tell you what the rate limit is, and then have a whole bunch of people make services that do *that* minus one, every day. So that it always stays under the rate limit but it still maxes out everything. The rate limit, currently, is 120 items saved per day.

Marco:  And I also count a portion of the previous interval's attempts, in the current interval. So that if you saved 120 yesterday, I'm going to count part of that towards today's. And the reason why, is because, let's say I have it at 120 per day, if your script is able to save 120 items per day, before it gets blocked, then every day, or whenever that limit gets reset, it's going to save another 120. So it's still never going to actually stop anything. Where I have it now, is that if your script is going crazy, and not even realising it's being blocked after 120, and it tries to save 500 in a day, the next day it'll still be blocked. And so, if something is going crazy and blowing the limit, it basically makes it stop indefinitely, instead of just hitting the limit every day. That's why the previous day kind of counts for the current day. So that's why there's the silent period et cetera, and why it doesn't reset immediately.

Marco: So, I want to set this limit, somewhere that normal reasonable use is never likely to hit. And I think 120 per day, is not that bad of a number to set, maybe I'll have to raise that; I'm certainly going to evaluate that. But I don't understand, honestly, how somebody can save 120 things per day and actually read any meaningful portion of those.

Dan: How could you read 120 articles per day, of any real substance? You think that maybe somebody who's hitting that limit, they're not really *reading* them, as much as they're using Instapaper as kind of like a long-term archival service.

Marco: Right. 

Dan: Which couldn't you use Tumble logs for that?

Marco: You can use lots of things for that, honestly. And maybe, if you're saving that much stuff, maybe something dedicated to long-term archival, like Pinboard, maybe that's more suited to it. I don't know what their limits are; I know they have limits, I don't know what their limits are.

Marco: I just know that I need to have *a* limit. We're really just arguing what the limit should be. And, I don't want to set it so high, so a lot of really expensive, damaging use is still possible. Like if I set it at 1000 a day; I have my servers just log, to the error log, whenever somebody is being throttled, whenever they submit a request that I'm refusing because of the rate limit. And I have it tell me, just their username and which limit they're hitting, because there's an hourly and a daily, and what their number is that they're currently hitting. So that way I can tell if someone is just barely exceeding it, or whether they're really, really blowing past it.

Marco: And, I see so many of them that are like 1000 attempts yesterday, 500 attempts yesterday, but some of them are like 150 and it's some RSS bot. And that's exactly the kind of use I want to block, and that's relatively close to the limit, so if I raised the limit there would still be a lot of that getting through. And I still don't really want people saving even an average of 100 things a day; even that I think is crazy. Because again, who are you really serving well by that? You know, you're making it hard for me to support that, you're making this collection that doesn't really work very well, because Instapaper was not made to deal with that kind of scale in the interface, in the apps, anywhere. And it will; I mean there's no limit to how many items you can have in your account; at least there's no hard, enforced limit. And there are people who have 50,000 items in their Unread folders. And it will work; it will just paginate forever. It will work. But, what can you really do with that in the interface I have; where I'm showing you like 20 per page, or the app downloads the most recent 500. What are you going to do with the other 45,000, or 49,500? What are you going to do with all those articles that you're saving? Can you ever do anything with those? If you're saving that many, even the search engine is not going to work that well, because how the heck is it going to rank something? When you type in a query, if you're actually going to search through all that, how is it going to know? Right now, I rank mostly just by time, you know, there's a little bit of query relevance analysis, but then after that it's just by time. Figuring that for the most part, when you search for something, for subscribers to search, for the most part when I search, I'm searching for usually one specific article that I'm thinking of, that I want to find the link to, or I want to find the quote from. And, I'm searching for a phrase usually, or four or five keywords. I'm not going to search my entire archive for 'Apple', because that's not going to return a meaningful result in my archive; I have hundreds of articles saved about Apple. So when you're saving 49,000 or 50,000 articles, what could you possibly be using my service for that it's going to work well for? That's the big thing: What are you doing with all these things? And if the answer is, nothing you can possibly do with this can work well and can serve you well even, and I'm just taking on a big burden for hosting it all, what am I supposed to do?

Marco: So, that's why I figure I know this limit has to be there and I really think that I've set it generously, at 120 a day right now. I'm not going to guarantee that that's what it'll be in the future, I might even change that later today. Right now, I believe that is a fair limit, and I believe the way it works is fair. So that's why it's done that way, and I think that's fine.

Marco: Feel free to email me...

Dan: Oh, they can email you?

Marco: Oh, no, no, no. Email Dan about what you think the rate limit should be.

Dan: Oh, great. You know people don't really do that, too much. I think they know you're kidding.

Marco: No, they still do. Alright, so, moving on to something a little bit nicer. I got another question, and I think we'll probably end it after this. 

Dan: OK.

Marco: Another question from Brendan Hutchins, and he says, "I've been thinking lately about how podcasters, not specifically your podcast", this is like "a *friend* has this problem". "Have talked about app prices and that because apps are so cheap you should just buy it not complain". I think I actually have said that. Anyway. "Now, I am not one to complain about high prices, but I do take FULL", in all capitals, "advantage of your apps price drops alerts and other thought just came to me. Since there are SO MANY", those are capitalized, "really good or great apps on the app store, like thousands!", exclamation point, "I could go bankrupt buying 3 to 5 dollar apps without caution.", I doubt that, "I even hesitate with 1 dollar apps. Sometimes. To my question, what app slash game, no matter what the price, has given you the best bang for the buck?". Alright.

Marco: I'm going to ignore everything about this question except for the very last sentence, because I think it's ridiculous. The very last sentence, though, is good. What app or game, no matter the price has given you the best bang for the buck?

Marco: Now for me, on the Mac it's potentially more interesting. On the Mac I think by far the best bang for the buck are things that help me do my work, or things that are required for me to do my work. Because these things, for the most part, are much, much cheaper than the value I get out of them. The biggest two by far are Xcode and TextMate. And I know I've been changing up my editor recently, so I will broaden TextMate to my editor; whatever that editor might be. You know, back in the day, back in the 80s and 90s when programming was a relatively newer field developer tools used to be extremely expensive. You used to have to pay like a thousand dollars for them, or more even. I remember Visual Studio, back when I first started coding I wanted to buy Visual Studio and it was like twelve hundred bucks. And, I just ended up buying Visual Basic by itself. I actually got a hand-me-down copy of Visual Basic 1 point Oh, in 1995, which was way later than that app came out.

Dan: Yeah, you're right: It was a very big industry and companies; there were companies all they did was build - we're not even necessarily talking about very fancy IDEs, I mean, you might have to pay thousands just for a compiler.

Marco: Exactly. This is still true of the industry today, where tools that somebody needs to get their work done can be priced a lot higher than general consumer stuff. It just so happens that text editors, I think, are priced way too low and developer tools are priced - usually most developer tools nowadays are free. Apple officically charges 5 bucks on the App Store for Xcode, if you're not a registered developer, and if you are a registered developer it's free. I don't know even why they charge the 5 bucks; maybe it's a weird accounting regulation. Maybe it's like a Sarbanes-Oxley thing, I have no idea. It's one of those things where you can see that Apple doesn't really care very much to charge for this, but they do. Kind of like their OS updates.

Marco: Oh, Carsons, in the chat, says it's free for everybody. Maybe that's outdated now. Anyway. So. These apps by far - I make my entire living using Xcode and TextMate, so, Xcode I paid 100 bucks a year to be part of the developer program, which is nothing when you're making your whole living from something. And TextMate, I paid 50 bucks for, once, like 6 years ago. So, obviously, those things are by far worth it. Another one I would cite, definitely, is [Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/). I love Soulver. It's spelled the British way, with a 'u': S-o-u-l-v-e-r. If you don't have this app yet, and you're listening to this show, stop right now and get this app. They have it in the Mac App Store, they have it separately I think still.

Dan: And now in the [show notes](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89).

Marco: It is. You need Soulver. Soulver replaces calculators and, in many cases, spreadsheets. It is *so* good. First of all, once you have Soulver installed, you will never launch Calculator again. At least, you shouldn't. If you have a Calculator in your Dock or something, just replace it with Soulver. You will almost never be working - if you are a programmer, or anything close to a programmer, you will almost never be working - and not have this app running; having a scratch document somewhere. It is *awesome*. It is basically a calculator-notepad and it's like what you'd expect the combo between a text document and a spreadsheet to be. It's really, really great. And, anyway, you've got to get Soulver. 

Marco: Soulver, again, I paid I think like, 25 or 30 bucks for it, 6 years ago or something, I don't know. When they launched it in the Mac App Store, I actually bought it again, just because I've gotten so much value out of it, I just wanted the ease of installation in the Mac App Store and not having to deal with my serial numbers anymore, so, I just bought it again, because I've just gotten so much value out of this app. What is it in the Mac App Store? Did you see when you looked it up?

Dan: Looking right now. I just found it on the website.

Marco: Yeah, I think it's like 20 or 30 bucks. 

Dan: Hold on; I'll tell you. They've got it for iPad and...

Marco: Oh, now I can't see the price because I bought it already.

Dan: Oh, you already bought it.

Marco: There it is. It's 12 dollars! 

Dan: 11.99.

Marco: OK.

Dan: Is it universal?

Marco: There is an iOS version, actually, there's an iPhone and iPad version.

Dan: That's it. Is it a universal one?

Marco: On iOS, I don't think so. I don't remember. I bought it so long ago I don't remember.

Dan: OK. I'll put these into the [show notes](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/89) as well.

Marco: On iOS I do use it, in place of calculator, but I just don't use it as often because I hardly ever need it on iOS. On the desktop, I use it constantly. It's alwayse open. You *have* to get this app. Anyway, so that's another thing; so now that it's 12 bucks, I have no idea why you wouldn't have this if you do anything with numbers ever in your work. Like, if Calculator is launched more than once a month for you, you need to have this app. It's just so much better than using a stupid, artificially constrained, desktop metaphor of a physical calculator. Calculators are the biggest example of skeuomorphism gone wrong in computers. The last thing you want, is to bring all the annoyances of a single line LCD calculator with buttons, to the computer, when you can have this instead. That's how good this app is.

Dan: 2.99 for iPhone and 4.99 for iPad.

Marco: Yeah, it's great. One thing I use it for a lot on iPad, actually, is keeping track of people's scores when we're playing card or board games. If you type in numbers, any kind of expression, it'll evaluate it and show you the result on the right side. But you can also type in just labels for things, and you can use variables and things. So, I'll say like, "Marco, colon 5, plus 10, plus 15, plus 23", I'll keep track of the running score as the game progresses. That way on the right side, it always shows my score. Then I'll have another line: "Tiff colon, 17, plus 14, plus 23", you know, all this stuff. So, it's just *so great* for so many things. You need to have this app. And so that, by far, having paid whatever it was - 20 bucks for it, 6 years ago, whenever I first got it - definitely was worth it. And if they ask for money for anything in the future, I will pay it. They should definitely be charging more than 12 dollars.

Marco: And then, on iOS the prices are so low; you figure what gives the best bang for the buck on iOS? I think, besides things that are free, which obviously have infinite bang - (sniggers) Josh. I think it's anything you use for a few minutes, or a more than a few times. Because, how much usage does it take to give you 3 dollars or 2 dollars of value for something. You figure, like when you're playing a game, I have spent 50 dollars on console games, or on old PC games, that I have gotten far less value out of than a lot of iOS games that cost 2 bucks. You figure how much time you spend playing it. If you're old enough - which of course you are, because you're ancient -  if you're old enough to remember what an arcade is, you would pay, if you're really old you would pay a quarter. If you're my age, you'd probably pay more like 50 cents, or maybe even a dollar to play a really good game in an arcade. For like 5 minutes, or less, sometimes. To think that you can pay 1 to 4 dollars these days, to have a really good game, on your *pocket computer*. It feels kind of weird to complain about getting a value out of that, or what value you're going to get out of that. To me, if somebody recommends a game to me, if I see a good review online, or see people talking about it, I'll just go buy it. I won't even necessarily read the reviews. I'll glance at the screenshots to make sure it's the kind of game I might like.

Dan: Is there a threshold? If a couple of people say, "it's pretty good". And you look, and it's 2 bucks, and you say, "I'll buy it". But what if it's 10?

Marco: Yeah, if it's 10 that's beyond the threshold. We've actually talked about this a lot before when deciding the Instapaper price. I think 3 and under is a no-brainer. 

Dan: Right. Do you have a limit? Would you do one a day? Would you only limit yourself to one a week? Or is it irrelevant; just any time there's some people talking about it.

Marco: Well this guy's saying that *he's* going to go bankrupt. I don't know.

Dan: Yeah, it's a problem.

Marco: He's saying he's going to go bankrupt buying thousands of 3 to 5 dollar apps. You can't even have thousands installed. What's the limit?

Dan: I don't think there is a limit.

Marco: What? Like 146 or whatever that was?

Dan: (laughs) No. That's not real. That's not real.

Marco: They raised that, I think. Anyway I'm pretty sure you can't have thousands of apps installed, on your iPhone. (laughs)

Marco: And even if you could, if you have an iPhone, is it possible in most cases, that somehow you accidently spend 3000 dollars on apps? Are you really going to go bankrupt from a 3000 dollar debt, if you own an iPhone? It could hurt. But going bankrupt is pretty severe. I don't think necessarily that would work, but, anyway. 

Marco: Any game I've played more than a few minutes or any app I've used more than a few times on iOS is well worth it's value. I think the games I've played the most, by total cumulative time spent, by far, are [Wurdle](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wurdle/id287712243?mt=8) and... Oh crap what's it called? The simple Risk clone? I forgot it already, because I haven't played in long. Hold on, I'm looking it up in my games folder. [Strategery!](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/strategery/id298908505?mt=8) Yeah, and [ORBITAL](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/orbital/id324012853?mt=8), too, those three. So, Wurdle - with a 'U' - W-u-r-d-l-e, Strategery and ORBITAL: By far, those three are the ones I've played the most. And they each cost, I don't know, 3 bucks, whatever, at most. Probably less now. I've played each of those for hours. Many, many hours in some cases. So, again, like best bang for the buck is very easy; whatever game you've played the most on your phone. If you've played it for more than a minute and it cost less than a few minutes, then I think you've gotten your value worth.

Marco: Alright, so, I think we're done. What do you think?

Dan: Yeah. I mean, this is a pretty good show. We did talk a lot about developer stuff this time, so I don't know if it will be received well or not.

Marco: I'll try to talk less about it next time.

Dan: Yeah. We don't want to start a trend, because this is like two episodes in a row.

Marco: Right.
