# Back to Work
## Episode 5 – Chigger Bites on the Bus Driver

Dan: Yep.

Merlin: Good morning, Captain.

Dan: Good morning, my good friend, Merlin.

Merlin: Ahh. I'm sorry I'm late.

Dan: No. I was late. I rescheduled.

Merlin: No, no. I was meta late, though. I knew you were going to be late and I *still* was like--there's no excuse.

Dan: Not a problem. Should we go live? Do you care?

Merlin: I care about everything, Dan. That's my problem.

Dan: That's a good topic. I'll go live, then.

Merlin: Yeah. I--the thing is, I'm always live, Dan.

Dan: Okay. Should I hit the 'live' button, then?

Merlin: I don't know. That's a decision you'd have to make.

Dan: Alright. I just did it.

Merlin: Alright. You know. A–always, B–be, ah broadcasting live. B. L.

Dan: I'm going to tweet it, too.

Merlin: A. B. B. L. See, this is awesome. I didn't know we were going to do it for the kids. I'm really glad you're doing this. Hi, kids! Hi--not kids. You're not kids. You're nerds. The reason I'm late, though--it's my own fault--what's a spiritual reason? I don't know if I've told you this, but I've undertaken a daily cheese danish practice. (lick-smacking) Mmm. Mmm. Mmmm. That's just full of Body.

Dan: I think you were having one of these the last time we were talking.

Merlin: Yep. You know what it is? I go through--You can't tell I'm eating, right? (cough)

Dan: Not at all. No. Not at all.

Merlin: I go through phases. I go through phases. Um. I'm frequently eating at the beginning of a You Look Nice Today episode, because I'm usually late. For a while, while I was doing that video series, I would eat an apple Galette every day. Mmm. It always sounded really, really gross when I ate 'em near the mike. Theses are pretty dry, though. This isn't as bad. (sniff) I'll get a Galette for next time. (cough)

Merlin: Maybe you need to drink something now, after this.

Merlin: You ready? Hang on. (sound of can opening) Aaaah. (drinking) Aaaaah. Productivity. (sniff)

Merlin: So, you've been busy! You've been busy, Dan Benjamin. What are you doing?

Dan: Today's been a busy day. I had a lot of shows that wound up, all having to get done today, but really you're going out of town, you're going to New Zealand. So what we're doing right now is we're recording this show--

Merlin: What do you mean, going out of town? It's Tuesday, I'm *in* New Zealand.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Hmmm.

Dan: We're recording this show early. People who are tuning in live, they'll hear it, but--most people will be hearing this on Tuesday of next week.

Merlin: Yep. I will have evacuated that Danish, by three days ago, Pacific time. Five days ago, New Zealand time.

Dan: (laughs) That's right.

Merlin: So. Oh my gosh, I'm probably already done pooping. Wait a minute. Let me do the math on this. Now, Sigourney Weaver--No! It's great, I'm glad we're doing this. I'm glad we're doing this, Dan Benjamin.

Dan: We're right here. We're breaking--we're already exceeding the expectations of most of the world. Because everybody was saying, "Well Merlin's only going to do three." And this is the fourth one.

Merlin: Uh, huh. Okay. So, so, so, so, so, B–I'm really cool about, like, letting you always, you know, spin things your way and make yourself look good, but A–tell them. Tell them how this went down. Give them the chronology, Mister let's talk about the show at the top of the show.

Dan: Alright. Alright.

Merlin: Give them the chronology. Why don't you drop some science? Yeah.

Dan: You said that I needed to 'Doodle' you, or 'Twiddle' you.

Merlin: Yeah. Doodle me, so we'll diary this.

Dan: And I didn't.

Merlin: Yeah. And then did I say it maybe, like, three more times? I said, "Doodle me, so we'll diary this"? 

Dan: And I didn't. And then, at the last minute--

Merlin: I'm sorry to interrupt you, Dan. But at some, did I mention a concept called 'compression'? Did I mention compression?

Dan: Yes.

Merlin: Okay. And did I mention that we need to diary that?

Dan: Yes. And I didn't. And then, you're doing the show anyway. I think you have to be on a plane, in like eight minutes.

Merlin: Mmhmm.

Dan: So thank you, for doing this.

Merlin: I literally--Phil Collins is right here, and he's idling the Concorde even though the Concorde has not run in years and Phil Collins can't fly a plane--this is how bad it's got. I couldn't get Travolta. He's at the celebrity Center this week. So I'm very excited.

Dan: Me too.

Merlin: Can I ask you a question?

Dan: Mmmhmm.

Merlin: Do you worry about spreading yourself too thin?

Dan: Ahh. I would worry about it if I weren't so good at doing it.

Merlin: That's a *totally* appropriate answer. Was that an unexpected question?

Dan: No. I've learned to expect all kinds of things from you.

Merlin: Hmm.

Dan: So really, there's no--an unexpected question--I don't really see a framework for that anymore.

Merlin: Mmhmm. Yeah. No. Well.

Dan: But, you know I--

Merlin: It's a two level question. It's a two level question. I actually for once *am* going to answer. Um. The two levels are--hang on a second, I shouldn't eat this on the air. (sniff)

Dan: No. You should. It adds--

Merlin: It's rude. It's rude. Especially--people in New Zealand don't do this. I've learned in my--three--days--that I've been here.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Can I just say that, in addition to like, liking you--as a human--genuinely liking you. I mean you're kind of weird but I've loved your work for a long time--but the thing that really grabbed me--so this is level one--level one is, um. The thing that really grabbed me--at some metaphorical level, by the collar, and made me want to come do this with you--is just the polish and the quality of everything you've done. I think it's a big part of what you do, in addition to the fact that you are genuinely like, a likable, interesting guy who tries hard, which you can't say for everybody. Is that your shows are really polished and they're really good and the people on them are really good and what not. And it's just--you know I don't listen to every podcast that *anybody* does--except myself--but like, you know, I mean I don't listen to every single show. Every single show I listen to is really good, comma, but, like it seems like you have a lot of properties and that seems like that--and you know me, right Dan? This is *not* a passive aggressive, I'm trying to get a slam in, I am genuinely asking this question--put differently, how would you know--and this will get to the second level, where this is interesting to other people--how would *you* know that you were spreading yourself too thin, with 5by5?

Dan: That's a good question. Here's the way that I look at it. This will frame it for you in a different way: A lot of people listen to the shows that we do and I'm on many--not all--but many of the shows that we do, and I hear this *all* the time, and I take this as a great compliment, because it means that people like the shows and feel--hopefully--positively compelled to listen to them--but they say, "Dan, you know, you're a *machine*. You're releasing so many shows. This is crazy." *Machine* is the thing I hear all the time. Which--you know.

Merlin: Ooh. You're like--

Dan: You're a *machine*.

Merlin: Like a commodity?

Dan: Like the Terminator. No. I don't--but here's the thing: They say, "You're doing all these great shows. You have all these great shows. How do you do so many? You have all these great co-hosts on them and everything." Well here's the thing: Number one–I feel like I'm cheating, because I have people on the shows who frequently do a *lot* of talking. If you were to look at this thing in Apple Logic and see--I do fifty percent or less of the talking on *most* of the shows. There's one--

Merlin: Alright. Don't rub it in. Don't rub it in.

Dan: No. No, it's true. The second thing is, if you were to look at traditional terrestrial or satellite radio, the shift for a radio talk show host is between--three if they're *really* good--but most do a four hour shift, five days a week. So that means that they show up and either six AM or ten AM or sometimes eleven--or if they're in the afternoon, then they work through the dinner time, drive time, time period--but they're doing a four hour shift. That's normal. Well if you look at the number of shows that I'm doing, I'm only doing four to five hours--a day--worth of shows. Now to me--

Merlin: As *talent*.

Dan: To me, I'm showing--

Merlin: That's just as talent.

Dan: Right. Yeah.

Merlin: I'm sorry. I'm using a douchebag, industry term but that's a term--on air talent, but you're also a producer, you're also the business guy, you're also a producer--like you're going out and getting people to be on. I don't mean to interrupt you, but yeah, I mean, the thing is--

Dan: I guess you're right.

Merlin: I'm just telling you, this is why The Merlin Show has--whatever--six episodes. It's like, gosh, sure I can show up. Why am I with you, Dan? In addition to loving you, I just show up and talk into a mic. But you have a lot--What you're really doing, if I understand the Dan Benjamin approach, is you're--boy you're creating a lot of expectations that you can fulfill, but they *are* a lot of expectations, because there's a lot of moving parts, to making all of this stuff show up on time. Right?

Dan: It is tight. I work long days. That's true.

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: I did get to see my son, though, earlier in the week.

Merlin: How's he doing? Is he getting bigger? Or is he staying pretty much the same?

Dan: Well, I mean, you know, he seems to be bigger. I got to see him, you know, briefly between dinner and bath time. I got to say, 'Hi.'

Merlin: You work from home though, right? I mean, usually that means not working and masturbating. Every time somebody says, "Working from home." I hear, "Masturbating during The Price is Right."

Dan: Right.

Merlin: "I've been working from home." Oh, nice. I worked from home on Saturday.

Dan: No. I do get to see him. That's the great thing about it. I have lunch with him and my wife every day, here at the house and I actually do get to spend a lot of time--because I don't have a commute and things--but I am working a lot. And I see that as a temporary thing. Once we can finally move into like a small, sort of, little studio I can have people, you know, to help in person, as opposed to everywhere else. I think those things will make a big difference. You know the hard part is the people who are working with me now, really it's all like part time, and would they move to where I have the studio? I don't know. It's all kind of up in the air.

Merlin: I mean, would they need to? I mean--

Dan: Maybe not. But I would like to have someone to help with the video, and help do the stuff that's right here in person and not just be me. Yeah.

Merlin: I want to hear every single bit of the rest of this, but I it reminds me a little bit of when people are like, "Oh, gosh. You know. I started this *blog*. And then I had some ads on it. Then I had some sponsorships. And I had all this stuff." And it always strikes me as funny--this is a different show, probably but I think this is an interesting topic--somebody starts out, and they *accidentally* become, like, weirdly successful by doing something unique, independently. And for a lot of people it seems like their first impulse is to figure out how to A–stop being unique, and B–stop being independent. And not all the time. But it seems like, "Oh, gosh. I can't *wait* to have a contractual obligation for a book." Another one is like, "I can't *wait* to have my project ruined by someone who doesn't understand it, for not that much money." You know? And it's like, in you're case if I were you, and I'm not, I'm not as successful as you--I don't own my house or anything--but like in your case I--my goodness--I would get, for the house? Sure, I mean clean out a tiny little room, maybe get the smallest room in the house, soundproof the crap out of it. But I would get the fastest Internet connection you can and then have your infrastructure live--you know what I mean? Right? You don't have to be broadcasting. Can't you 37Signals this a little bit?

Dan: Well that's how it is right now.

Merlin: Is it problematic? Or do you wish you were in a room? Do you want to be in a room?

Merlin: That's how I've been doing it. Well the problem is--you know, on the one hand I would love to be able to have somebody here to help out with a lot of this stuff. There's an incredible--even for the production that we do now, there's a lot of gear, there's a lot of computers, there's a lot of stuff to do. And having all of this in your house it--yeah, it's super convenient and I don't want to commute. What I'd like to do, is I'd like to have like a little studio that's like, literally, in the backyard in it's own little freestanding, little place that I could go. And the big reason for that is soundproofing is one thing, but when you've got three–year–olds running through the house yelling, there ain't no soundproofing that I'm going to be able to put in here that would really do that job well enough. I mean, yes, I'll get emails now. But--

Merlin: No, you're totally right. I hadn't thought of that. But I think about, like on MacBreak, with--God, poor Leo, I mean back before he was really staffed up--all this stuff with like, "Oh, we've gotta get the Marrantz or whatever. We've gotta switch this cable to that, and now we're not getting the"--whatever it's called, the double line–back–through–thingy.

Dan: Mix minus.

Merlin: Yeah, exactly, mix minus, exactly. It's always mix minus. It's like, I could see how that could be totally frustrating. But for you, like, do you like--it's weird, because  obviously you're a professional, you've done stuff for years as like a real grown-up. But like, I like that question of how would you know if X. Or, how *will* you know when Y, happens? You know what I mean? Do you have a gut sense of when you'd know you're where you'd wanna be, mostly, for now? You know what I mean? In terms of like, whether--I don't know how you think about your goals and stuff but--I think it's something that a lot of people either are thinking about, or should be thinking about, is in addition to all of this, you know, "What cloud do I wanna ride with the dragon, to get to my dreams?" More like, you know, how would I know if I'm doing too much? Or how would I know--? How will you know when you need to make a jump? Or how will you know when you need to pull back?

Dan: That's a great question. I mean, I love--I really like things just the way that they are right now. I don't think that I could really do any more. And I think--I think I would like to off-load some of the things that I'm doing right now, just so I could have *some* time to relax, and not, you know, finish the day fifteen minutes before I need to go to sleep.

Merlin: Oh, totally. I had to basically--not *had* to, I chose to, and continue to practice, a few little things that--If you have--I mean, gosh! (laughs) Again, talk about first world problems, "Oh, it's really hard." I timed it: When I found the office near my house--and it's really, really, really near my house--I timed it.

Dan: How far are you from there?

Merlin: I brought along my information phone and I hit the timer and it took, at a normal pace, it to three minutes and twenty seconds from door to door.

Dan: That's so awesome.

Merlin: Really. Literally it's--

Dan: Only in San Francisco.

Merlin: I don't want to create too much of a, like, triangulation situation here, but like it's literally round the corner. (laughs) So. Yeah. I mean--and I *don't* go home for lunch as much as I could, just because, you know, my wife likes having her own life too. No, but it *is* great. And, like, our kid, you know, I just hop on a street car to pick up my kid from school.

Dan: That's great.

Merlin: And, it's--that I--gosh! Sure, would I ever give that away? I mean. Dan, we need to have some kind of a service. Can we just work to hire somebody who goes out and fact-checks things that I say and goes and finds the citation, please? Maybe you could--could we find somebody maybe in the chatroom? If there's somebody in the chatroom, who's like a librarian, that would like to be my brain: Go find the citation for this--that every ten minutes of time that you add to your commute, shaves off some X percent, that's almost the same number of percentage points in terms of quality of life--I don't know if that's true. But they say, you know like, people who live in Atlanta, who have to travel like ninety minutes to get to work just have this *excruciatingly bad* quality of life.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Because--and especially, now in my case, like, when we would jump on Caltrain just to go down--my wife worked at Stanford and I worked in Menlo, so--you get on Caltrain and you just sit there and drink coffee and tune out, but like, gosh, would podcasts exist if people didn't have to sit in traffic and scream. That's just the worst.

Dan: I think there's a *huge* percentage of people that listen to these shows while they're in their cars, you know, while they're driving. And, you know, that's something that as somebody who did that for *a decade* or more of, you know, having a thirty–plus, or forty five minute commute, regularly, each way: I *wish*--

Merlin: Oh my god! I would have killed--

Dan:  --that I had had this kind of thing back then. Of being able to listen to people who I like to hear, guests who I was interested in, having like friends.

Merlin: For me it was Audible. Back then it was Audible.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I had one of those tricked out--like, back in the day when I had my little Diamond Rio 64 or whatever it was. Yeah. I loved that. But, you know, what I was going to say was, that like, the one--if there *is* an upside to that--and there really *isn't*, but--you *can* if you work it, really have a break between work and home. Now I understand that doesn't really happen, because you've got a Blackberry and stuff. But. In my case I had to start--I started doing several little David Allen-esque *hacks*. And I'll tell you two, that really work for me--and we're probably already off-topic, but I think this is kind of useful. So my problem was I would get home--and I've described this to you before. I think we've talked about this. I know I've talked about this in an interview and I *think* it was with you, but--I got to where with this book stuff, and all these different projects--you know when you work on your own there's no walls. The walls are like made out of ice cubes, like, they're not really that substantial. You know what I mean? Like, you're--I *can* work from pretty much anywhere, but my work is so *weird* and *whatever* anyway--that really--I've said this since nineteen ninety five--my job can be conducted with pretty much any computer and text editor and access to FTP. That's *pretty much* what I do. Um. A reduced subset of almost everything I need to do, is that. I mean, sometimes, you know, it involved Cold Fusion, rather than a straight text file. You know what I mean?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Like, you *can* do it from anywhere, but boy, think about that. It's like, you really *do* have to fight that urge to constantly--like in you're case, you know, it's really: You get the worst of both worlds because, yeah you've got a three year old yelling and you want to yell back but you also want to go hug him, but you've also got to do this thing, so shut up.

Dan: Yeah. No, that's it. Exactly.

Merlin: Right? On some level.

Dan: No. That's it *exactly*. 

Merlin: You know, and, so here's two things that I did--and I do want to hear the rest of your thing, so this gives you time to think. Number one: Once I'm on the block, like once I can *see* my house, phone is turned off and headphones are removed. So, not even music, not even anything, certainly not email. This sounds really stupid, but it's made a really big difference. And, this is going to sound really, really dumb, but I've got a wallpaper picture of my kid, on my iPhone. So what I do, is I have this ritual where I take off my headphones, I turn off my phone and I turn it back on, and I look at a picture of her. And I go, "This." You know? This sounds *so* stupid. But otherwise, what am I going to do? I'm going to walk in there and like, now I've got an email I just got and I'm *mad*? And like, she wants to show me something she drew. She drew me a picture. Like, she just drew a map the other day: This amazing thing, like, to show elephants and rabbits how to get home. She wants to come show me this map, she made for me. And I'm going to sit there and yell at my email? Well, I'm telling you, turning it off, putting it away: Huge.

Merlin: The other one? And especially when she was a baby--an infant--this was huge. The laptop doesn't even come out of the bag. Or in this case you could say the iPad or  the whatever, the iPhone. It doesn't even come out of the bag until she's asleep. Which sounds like, "Okay. That's mmmhmm." But even if it's *out*, you're going to use it. It's--you know what I mean--you have to act like, you know, the cigarettes are *locked* in this cabinet. You know what I mean?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Those helped a *lot*.

Dan: And I *totally* didn't say my, "That's what *she* said" joke when you just gave me the opportunity.

Merlin: Hmm. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Now, do you *have* anything like that? Like, is he allowed to *play in* there, when you're not in there? Or is it really, like, Daddy's sacred space?

Dan: Oh, no. Well, a lot has changed between the days when I was doing software development, or being a, you know, CTO from, you know, this room, to now. Because, before I didn't have video cameras and wires and mixers and computers and everything. And now, it would be more of a dangerous place for him. He comes in, but before he used just to be able to come in whenever he wanted and play in here and whatever. But now, with all this stuff in here, something would get broken: Him or something else. So, it's not so much being like a sacred space, as it is being just not a good place for a three–year old to be.

Merlin: A three year old boy, with a *lot* of energy.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: He's pretty energetic, right?

Dan: Oh, yeah. And, so I think, yeah. In that sense, no. In a way it's easier for me to separate work from family than it used to be before. Because, before it was all about email, or writing a little bit of code or whatever. And it was super easy to just, "Well, I'll just open the laptop for a *second*. Just check in." Or, "I just want to add this one little feature." Whereas now, it's like, if the microphone's not turned on, yeah I still have to do work, I still have to do email, but most of that stuff happens during business hours, so I try really hard to limit it. But, I really like doing the, you know, interacting with people. I really like responding to people who email me or talk to me on Twitter or whatever. And that's the hard part for me, is to say, this'll wait till tomorrow. You've gotta do it. You know?

Merlin: It really, literally does never end.

Dan: It *Never* ends.

Merlin: Not necessarily in a bad way, but what's funny is we're both pointing to something, in both cases, whether it's working at home, or whether it's working near home, or whether it's accessed via electronic means, is that there is no built in scarcity to any of that. Okay. So, for example, like in a traditional--what I would call Richard Scarry. Beg your pardon.--What I would call a Richard Scarry job. You do have a couple of built in constraints, I think. It's not like suddenly we've invented having a lot more work and that's a new thing.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: But I really do believe that there was a time--I just think about when I was a kid, and to me a canonical example was that you would never call somebody on a Sunday night. I don't know if this is just a mid-western protestant thing, but like, you would *never*--I mean there was just understood rules--every kid, every family I knew, understood certain things. You never called somebody's house after nine PM, unless it was a big important thing. Now, I'm forty four, so maybe that's just something--yo know, Clifton Webb era stuff--but you would *never* call somebody on a Sunday at ten o'clock at night. You just *would never do that*. That would be *so*--you might as well just go over their house *naked* and ask to borrow a cup of whiskey--it would just be *so* weird to do that. But today, you know, because it's asynchronous, you know, even though our ideas about the response time may be anything but--you know what I mean? It could be very specific. But there's no limitation to that amount of quote-unquote *work*. You know? And again, *is it* all work? Well, no: You enjoy it. It's great. Some email, is about Facebook zombies. Some of it is about people who want to give you money. Like, were there that many things, apart from the telephone, in the forties that were the source of both work and family stuff?

Dan: Yeah. That's a great point.

Merlin: I mean, how many times would you bring somebody home, at eleven o'clock, to sit on the porch swing and talk about the Nakamichi deal? Like, I don't think that happened. You had a place you went that was called, you know, the office, or the job. You know? And I think in a lot of polite societies--and I think this could be my mid-western bias--you just didn't really--the men would go and talk about work--but by and large you didn't just sit around and talk about you job, you know, all the time. So, anyway. I'm just saying. The nature of the work, quote-unquote, that we're talking about is that when it involves people and communications it *is* unlimited, but then that access is also unlimited, *because* we can do that from anywhere. I *hear* you. There's a reason why there'll be some New York Times magazine or two about, "Let's all do woodworking!" Because people crave that, like, "I want to make a real thing, that does real things."

Dan: Yeah. Of like, putting your hands on something. 

Merlin: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like I always joke about on the podcast--the other podcast, you know--fake Internet money, fake Internet everything, you know. It starts to become this weird Baudrillard kind of simulacrum kind of life. Where you're just, you feel like you're almost living in a diorama. You know? But, in your case, you said on our last visit, that you think pretty long--

Dan: (laughs) "Last visit."

Merlin: Yeah. (sighs) I don't believe in--I like self-reference in almost everything except programming. I don't like the word, 'podcast'. I *really* don't like the word, 'netcast'. But I also don't like podcast. I think, we call these, 'visits'. These are visits.

Dan: I like it. It reminds me a little of like what a therapist would say at the end of the--

Merlin: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

Dan: On the couch. You know?

Merlin: Yeah. How does that make you feel?

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: How does *this* make you feel?

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: What about *this*?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: How about that? Uh huh.

Dan: Yeah. I like it.

Merlin: It's just the second knuckle.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Um. I don't know what I was going to say.

Dan: Doesn't matter now.

Merlin: Doesn't matter now. (softly) Boom. (hums an ominous sounding march)

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Um, no. So, anyway. Knowing when it's enough. Ah. Because, what we talked about in our last visit--(laughs) Hey! What happened? What the F is up with Jim? I got *no* plate reverb on that last--

Dan: I put a marker on there. I don't know, I like it--we can put your whole thing on plate reverb this time.

Merlin: You know what, he's dead to me. Um. I kid.

Merlin: Ah, you talked about how, you thought about, what did you say? Something like, oh, you think for six months about something before you make a big change, you know?

Dan: Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah yeah. Even smaller things. Yeah.

Merlin: Well I guess we should broaden this to be--I hope this is interesting to talk about because I think it does apply to everybody. And if we get past the, Merlin yells at everybody about not doing it right, I think there's something we can all *sort* of agree on, which is: It's not always easy to know--again, now this is the topic of what I will be talking about, Gosh, probably while this is running, on Tuesday--which is this notion of how do you know if you're paying attention to the right things? And how do you know--you know what I mean? You're always doing this kind of forward and backwards looking thing and getting the Don Murray idea. You're always kind of reacting to the past and thinking about the future, but you never really know if you're *exactly* in the right place. And so I think sometimes it is really hard to know, you know, like with your stuff, with your podcast stuff, like, you probably don't have a specific number in mind whether that's for *audience* or for *number of shows* or *number of sponsors*. I mean, you know, and that's kind of the art of all of it, isn't it? Like, there's this continuum of zero listeners, zero money, zero anything and there's infinite, but there's really going to be somewhere in between. You know? And I wonder how many of us walk around going, like, well you know, almost like, is it Milton? Or what's his name, from Office Space? You know? Where you've just got this mental count, where--

Dan: Yeah. With the stapler.

Merlin: If you take my stapler one more time I'm setting the building on fire.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: Like, that's as good as we get at really keeping score of how things are going. You know what I mean? It's--I think it's hard to keep--

Dan: Well keeping score *is* hard. Even if you *do* have a goal, or set a goal. I mean goals are good, right? That could be a whole show right there: setting goals. But, I guess, if you set a goal what happens when you get there? Do you say, well now I'm not going to do anything else new? Or I'm not going to make any changes? You know.

Merlin: Well I would even go a *giant* step further back than that and--You know, Dan, I apologize, I'm a contrarian, that's just how I am. No I'm not. It drives me crazy, because you know the thing is people go, "Oh, goals are great." And I go, "No, they're not." And they go, "Goals are terrible." And I go, "Well, no, actually goals *can* be good." Because they're both--they can be great *and* terrible. And I mean, with goal, well first of all, you know, (sighs) I kind of--I'm sorry. I do rag on certain sort of guru-type people, I have to admit--but I think when you give people a really unreasonable, unrealistic idea of something that's not going to happen. If you give people some really pie in the sky idea of, if you go and do this magic formula you're going to become a bajillionaire. If you give people these really unrealistic ideas based on not particularly much, you know you really stoke the fire and industry that makes people want to do stuff but it's not really cool that you've told them something that's really just a scam.

Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: You know what I mean?

Dan: No, I do.

Merlin: And a lot of this self-help stuff, let's be honest, it really *does* amount to a scam and a Ponzi scheme. A *lot* of it really is. You know? I mean, when's the last time--like Tony Robbins. Tony Robbins seems like a *super* nice guy. I would love to just go, "Tony Robbins is a bad human being." But he actually seems like a really nice guy. When is Tony Robbins going to put out a book that says, seriously, like if you've read all my other forty–nine books, don't buy this one. I literally don't want you to buy another one of my books. Here's my next book: You want my next book? Stop buying my books.

Merlin: There's never going to be a day. You know? I always come back to this one Dead Kennedy's song from--what is it? It's from Plastic Surgery Disasters, I think--it's called, 'Trust Your Mechanic', and you know it's whatever, typical sophomore, awesome Dead Kennedy's song, but it's like trust your mechanic. Well, because trust your mechanic, you go in whether that mechanic is your doctor or whether it's the person who fixes your car: You go in there and you say, "Hey, my car's not working right." and they go, "Okay. I'll fix it." They tell you what's wrong with it, and then they tell you how much it's going to cost to fix. Nobody ever goes into their mechanic and goes, "I have ten thousand dollars, what should I do?" Right? That would be the stupidest thing in the world, bet there are all of us, you know, there aren't that many mechanics that are going to go, "Your car is fine. I don't need to fix anything." They'll find *something*.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: And in the same way, like whether it's like a therapist or whether it's any kind of person who stands to make money from you being a little bit broken or feeling a little bit broken. Like--I got derailed. But that bugs me. That just bugs me. Because it really does kind of keep you addicted to non-self, non-help. You know? I believe that personally. But I mean, the funny part with *job*, I think, and maybe almost as much for a company, is the amount of--as I kind of intimated--I think we get really emotional. Don't you think? You get so much skin in the game about what people owe you, and like maybe this is just me but I remember feeling like I had *scores* to settle. I remember, "Oh. I will watch and wait." You know?

Dan: About what? About what?

Merlin: Oh, about everything. I mean I just remember when I worked in an office I just remember being *obsessed* with status. And now when I go into an office, like all I see is status. All I see is people's status.

Dan: Oh, people who go, "Oh. I want *fifteen* direct reports by the end of the next quarter." Or something like that.

Merlin: I have so many stories. There's this one guy in particular--and you need the visuals for me to really do my impersonation--but the family owned company I worked for when I got out of college hired this guy as their, quote-unquote, marketing person and this guy couldn't market his way out of a wet paper bag. I mean, he was one of the most farcical adults I've ever met in my life. He basically spent all of his time on the acquisition of meaningless, superficial, non-status-building status things. So if he saw that you had a three–ring binder, he really wanted three, three–ring binders. He didn't really need a three–ring binder, but now he would find a reason.

Dan: (laughs) Oh, man.

Merlin: So now. The thing is. Now. Get ready, there's a big box of Buddha at the end of this. So he's like, Okay, now he needs three–ring binders but he needs *more* than you. And now he needs a reason to fill that. Okay? So *now* he's going to have to, (as Dave) "Hey, Peg. Can, I--(tongue-click)" He made this little (tongue-click), "Peg, (tongue-click), Peg, can I---? (breathing out) Aaaaaah" His name was Dave.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: (as Dave) "(breathing out) Aaaaah. Peg, Aaaah. (tongue-click) Aaaah. Can I borrow your just like--I don' know--like two hours to just go ahead and, uh, taking run off all of this?"

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: (as Peg) "Well whatdya mean, Dave?"

Merlin: (as Dave) "Well, Aaaaah (tongue-click). Ahhh. I need to get, uh, a background copy of each one of these from our archival, uh (tongue-click), and uh." So basically he would have seven people to like just run off copies of stuff and just punch holes in it. To fill his three ring binders.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Well now he needed a place to put his three ring binders. And so, he needed bookshelves. Okay? So, you see where this is going.

Dan: I do.

Merlin: And then it became lamps. Because now he needed lamps, for all this. And at one point when people would go to lunch, he would go and he would take their lamp. And he had *seven* lamps in his office. Because he's pretty convinced, you know?

Dan: Are you're kidding?

Merlin: He had seven lamps. Desk lamps. Yeah, yeah. In different places. He had floor lamps, he had desk lamps and (tongue-click), "Aaah" I will never forget, and then one day finally he was dissatisfied, he had a CX and that wasn't enough for him, so he comes in and goes, (as Dave) "(tongue-click) Aaaah." And he, "(tongue-click) Aaaah." He's always like, (sound of a metallic object being hit) hitting something or, "(tongue-click)" kind of clicking something, or kicking something with his shoe. It was like some kind of like tap-dancing Tourettes thing he would do.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: And he would go, (as Dave) "(tongue-click) Oh, Marlin. I gotta tell you. (tongue-click) Aaah. (tongue-click) Can I ask you a question?"

Dan: (laughs) Marlin!

Merlin: Yes, Dave. (as Dave) "(tongue-click) Aaah. Whatdya run there? You got one of them--? You runnin' one o'them thirties?" Yes, Dave, this is an SC30. This is an SC30. (as Dave) "(tongue-click) Aaah. Man. I gotta get me more o' them chigger-bytes on my bus-driver. Aaaah. Aaaaaaaaaah. How'm I gonna get more fonts on my desktop? (tongue-click) Aaah. Wha--How'm I gonna get one o' them thirties? (tongue-click) Aaah."

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: So now he needs a thirty! Because he needs more chigger-bytes on his bus-driver. Right?

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: And then, of course, he gets a new *thirty*, which of course as you know, Dan, as a computer person, once you got a thirty, then you need a new lamp.

Dan: Yeah. So--

Merlin: Sorry, that was--

Dan: That was *great*, though.

Merlin: Well. That's--and the thing is, that's been me. You know? Talk about a teachable moment, like, that's *so* been me. I mean, gosh, I don't think I've mentioned this yet on this show, the term Freud came up with called The Narcissism of Minor Differences. When you get really, really emotionally wound up and stuff and you feel how similar you are to other people, you start looking for meaningless differences that can make you dislike them. And, boy, that story's probably one of them: Like, he was just a not particularly bright guy from Georgia, and I was just mean to him--but he *really was* dumb--but he was a resource drain: He made more than me, I found out, and it made me so mad, because I worked hard on that Thirty. I worked really hard.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Best Mac I've ever owned. But, I don't know. Maybe you didn't have that--as a CTO guy--I don't know, maybe I don't know if you faced that but to me, working in a cube farm, I think that's why--say what you will--

Dan: But I was only CTO for like--out of the last seventeen or eighteen years--maybe year and a half, or two, of it.

Merlin: Have you worked in cube farms, before?

Dan: Oh, *yeah*. Oh, yeah. Most of my professional career was spent in a cube. (laughs)

Merlin: I'm guessing on the *earlier* end of your career spectrum. After the startup-ish nineties thing?

Dan: I was in cubes there, too. But, yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: Really? Okay.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: So did you--I don't know, I'm just curious--

Dan: Most of my time was in cubes.

Merlin: Did you feel--over time--different working in--(sighs) this is such a loaded question, I'm just going to say what I think: I think I behave really differently depending on that kind of environment.

Dan: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Merlin: You know what I mean? If I'm in a cube farm, or I'm just like, you know, how many items of *flair* am I going to have, that makes me look different. Think about that, you know, think about that lady that looks like a hippo that works at one of these companies, she's been there for like *ninety* years. She's got all the pins. You know? She's always the push-back lady. She's always like, "Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah! That's Martin Luther King day--I'm not gonna be here." You know? Or, you know? You know what I'm saying?

Merlin: Or like, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No. I was employee of the month *that* month, so that means I get this extra danish *this* month." You know what I'm talking about? 

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: All this *entrenched*--(whispering) you see this especially in government, you see this especially in academics, I think--I'm *sorry*. I'm just *literally* castigating millions of people, but. I have this thing that I'm particularly obsessed with--we talked about this on The Conversation, that time, but--I don't know. I think if you *don't* have that entrepreneurship, if you haven't figured out how to do it, you start noticing stuff like how many lamps you don't have. And when you're just *stuck* in that environment, it's--Ugh. Did you act, or feel, any different when you were in a cube farm, versus when you were in your private office, versus--

Dan: Oh, yeah. No, those many years in cubes were the darkest time of my professional life--speaking about professional life--it was the darkest time. It was the worst. Absolute worst. I hated it. And I mean have a whole host of bizarre reasons why *I* hated it. I mean, for one thing, I'm light sensitive to certain lights that vibrate on a certain frequency, like fluorescent lights and things like that. I would get migraines really bad from them, so I would get up on my desk and turn off the lights above my cube because otherwise I would get migraines. And people always used to enjoy, oh, you know, "Oh, there's Dan, turnin' off the lights." And I didn't *like* working in the dark but I would the guy like, "Why are these lights always on?" And the maintenance guy would always show up at my cube, and I'd be like, "No. I turned them off." He'd be like, "Whatdya mean you turned 'em off?"--Yeah, I turned them off.

Merlin: Where do you think Dave got the idea for desk lamps, rather than the overhead? I totally--I was the same way. And people thought I was like a psycho, like you know that I was in--what do they call it? Troglodyte mode?--like I felt the same way.

Dan: Terrible environment, though. The worst.

Merlin: Oh, it's brutal.

Dan: And, you know, I think that's why, like, *these days*--I really don't--I always talk about how I think offices can be *so* bad. I think it's possible to build a really good office, but, maybe part of it is spending a decade in these terrible cubes where you're using computers that are underpowered, and setup improperly, and are locked down beyond you ability to install even the most basic software on them. You know? I think we talked about this, I remember--

Merlin: We did! We should link to that. That one Conversation we talk about on every episode of this show, too.

Dan: Yeah. I mean, it's just such a depressing environment and it's so *not* conducive to the way most people work. And yet it's so predominant. And for me that was just a terrible--those cubes--it was just a terrible, terrible time that lasted and lasted. And my wife spent ten years in that environment and it was anemic and harmful.

Merlin: I totally agree.

Dan: I can't say enough *bad* about that kind of environment.

Merlin: Oh, I know. Well, one thing that makes this more complicated even than what we're describing is that it's different for everybody. I mean there are some people who like their environment a certain way and it's, you know--gosh, if it works. I think one of the worst things you can do is just go in and, by fiat, start changing stuff around because you feel like changing stuff around. That drives people crazy.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: For some reason--I don't know why I'm thinking this, I haven't thought this through at all--it's funny how on some level I.T.--I.S., whatever--they pick the crappy software that operations have to use, but then operations pick all the crappy lights that I.T. and I.S. has to suffer under. It's almost like, you know it's funny. It isn't like the *nerds* get to pick the lights, and it isn't necessarily--I bet the final buying decision is not *made* by the people who *use* the software a lot of the time.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: You know what I mean? It isn't like you're at a startup where you could go like, "Hey, which one of these would you prefer?" There's, you know--gosh there's any overarching generalization that I'll get yelled at for today--you know, well why did Windows sell? Well Windows was easy to buy and it was easy to install and it was, you know, hard to get rid of. You know? It really was, like a lobster-trap in a lot of ways. Or a roach-motel. Or, you know. Just whatever a thing is that's unpleasant and then traps something that's equally unpleasant: That's, kind of, Windows. Don't you think?

Dan: Yes!

Merlin: Setting aside the whole, like, there's never a good day to admit that we haven't needed Windows all along. You know? I think when you get into a bigger group like that you really stop seeing the impression of the different people on the team and there's such a dissociation. Ugh. Well, you know, how much time do we have? We got ten minutes?

Dan: Yeah, sure.

Merlin: But as far as the kids--the nerds, I call 'em the nerds--knowing when you've got enough, or when you've got the right thing. Do you agree that that's kind of an artful thing?

Dan: Oh, yeah. Well it's a *black* art.

Merlin: A *what*?

Dan: A *black* art.

Merlin: Oh, a *black* art. Totally. I totally agree. I totally agree. And I think the problem is--just back to the thread we dropped a while back--it's like the stock market almost, or anything else where you're trying to make a decision based on evolving information. And, you know, for example if you were going to invest in something, you'd want to know--you not only want to know what it costs today, and you not only want to know what it costs during the IPO, but gosh, you're sure going to want to see some trend lines for in between.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Right? There's that thing they say, like one data point is not a trend and you know really even two doesn't prove much. You need at least three data points to show something interesting at all. But, I don't know. I don't know. I think that our data sampling sometimes is--even setting aside all of the biases and heuristics and, you know, errors, judgement errors of how we see things, even if we always saw perfectly--it's kind of hard to *know*. It kind of gets us back to that conservative, you know--the thing we talked a couple of shows back--that thing of like always erring on the side of being extra, super conservative? So you might say well, "*Since* I don't have *all* the information. And since I don't have all the *current* information. And since I *know* that I'm scared about what I don't know. That's more than enough to tell me that I should basically not do much."

Dan: Well, yeah. That has the potential to shut somebody down.

Merlin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. You know what's funny is--and this is again, back to that Veen interview--I think there's the Dan Benjamin character--can I call him that? Do we need a name for that character?

Dan: I don't know which one you mean. But sure. Yeah. Call him.

Merlin: You know, I don't have an impersonation of you.

Dan: Do it! Work on it. Do it for the next show.

Merlin: Give me a second here.

Dan: Okay.

Merlin: (as Dan) "Yeeeeah. but thaa.... Yeah, Merlin, but people are gonna say thaaaaaaat's fine for Merlin, but aaaaaaaaaeeeeey."

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: What's that character's name? Where that guy--

Dan: You can call that guy--(laughs) you can call that guy, Dan--

Merlin: We can call it 'That's Fine for Merlin Guy'? (laughs)

Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I like that.

Merlin: T. F. F. M. G?

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Well, you know, in terms of the That's Fine for Merlin Guy, I think the funny part is, and people who haven't listened to this Jeff Veen says so many smart things on that episode--

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: What are you laughing at, smart ass?

Dan: Nothing, I just enjoyed the impressions--

Merlin: (as TFFMG) "Aaaaaaaaaay people are--Aaaaaaay People in the chatroom are asking...Whhhhhy? Aaaaaaah."

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: The thing is, it's like MySQL, I gotta do it every day, or I lose it.

Dan: Uh huh.

Merlin: You know? I used have a great Jesse Thorn and now I can barely do it. I'm not going to try. (sighs) I shouldn't have gotten that coffee. I think--I think (sighs)--I don't know what I think.

Merlin: Anyway. Go listen to that Jeff Veen episode because so much of this show will make more sense. Don't you think in some ways--the more I think about it--that episode where you, me and Veen talked and--talk about responses--I got so much nice email.

Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was a fun one. You guys talked so much about a lot of these issues, you know, of creating a good work environment and all of the potential--I mean really, you know, at the end of the day, though, what are people going to do? What are people going to do if they're trapped in that kind of cube situation.

Merlin: (laughs hysterically) You could set your clock by it. It's how you know it's the last scene of the play is when Dan talks in that voice, (laughs) as That's Fine for Merlin Guy. (as TFFMG) "Yeeeeeaaah, but."

Dan: Well, I just get to the point, where I try to remember what it's like. I never want to lose touch with that. So listen to me--

Merlin: No, Dan--

Dan: Listen to me. Let me speak.

Merlin: (laughs) Go ahead. Go ahead.

Dan: When I was in high-school I would write notes to myself, that would say, "Don't forget how much *this sucks*. Don't remember this in a positive way, because it really did suck. Don't think of this as your golden years. High school sucks." And I had written a note like that every year--really starting in junior high, on--I didn't write it as much in college, because college wasn't quite as bad. And I noticed that if I don't have the memories of myself writing those notes, I would look back on it and think, "Yeah, high school was pretty great." 

Merlin: Right.

Dan: And there were things about it that were pretty great. I mean, you know, I didn't have to worry about paying bills and that kind of stuff. So in that sense--

Merlin: Oh, God. I wouldn't go back for the world. Never. Never in a million years.

Dan: But that's the thing: Overall it was pretty horrible. I would never want to go back, and you know I think about it and I think: I felt the same way about most of those cube jobs. But there's a lot of people who are driving to one of them right now while they're listening to this. And now we're depressing them. So, you know, you're the guy that goes and talks to all the big businesses and helps people turn it around and feel good about it. What are they going to do? I'm going to put it to you. You brought this up: What do they do about it? I don't want them to, you know, they're listening to this right now on their commute in, now they're going to turn around an walk home. Maybe they should.

Merlin: Well. First of all--

Dan: But you can set your watch by it because, you know, we only have an hour to do these shows, so yeah, the last ten minutes I've gotta ask you that question.

Merlin: It's, yeah. And I'll always, mostly, answer the same, I think: So, first of all, I think the fact that you're doing that is incredibly instructive and useful. I don't want to just sit here and *rant* about something that seems really opaque to people. But, I mean, to me, there are--Okay, so this is not an answer, but it's one *opinion* about why I feel the way I do. I don't have a complete answer, but if I were going to try to summarize *my own* views about this and why I sound so confident about this thing that seems insane and only works for me--well first of all, I've *seen* who it really works for. And when I talk about this stuff, what I'm talking about are issues involving taking responsibility for your stuff, having a certain amount of agency, not relying on other people to kind of make the decisions about what you do, or conversely not just waiting for stuff to be visited upon you when you can avoid it. Taking risks, just in the sense of allowing yourself to, you know, wonder how this *could* be different. I mean there's a million things we're talking about in this constellation of this, "this is fine for Merlin" type stuff.

Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: I don't know how you'd summarize it except the way that I've been trying to think about it, you know as I try to work on this book, is that maybe in the way that I pitched this to Webstock--where did I say this?--anyway. At one point I was trying to summarize everything I thought--because you got me thinking about it in that Pipeline interview--I was trying to summarize it as, that as you increase your expertise and your independence, well, if you increased your expertise it's kind of hard *not* to increase your independence. And as you increase your independence, you kind of can't help but improve your expertise. And I'll give you some examples of that. I know that sounds silly and you're going to have to think about it for a minute. But what do I mean? Well, Okay, when you get really, really *good* at something, right? Let's say, just as an extreme example, let's say you're not good at *anything*. Let's say you're like me in high school, and you did work at McDonalds. I had no self-esteem, I had no interest, I had no nothing, and I had the job that showed that. Which is, I worked at McDonald's and I was scrubbing dumpsters at three in the morning--in a van down by the river.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: But--I just saw that again the other day: It's *still* funny.

Dan: It is.

Merlin: "Matt's been down in the basement eating NoDoz for four hours." But it was true: I mean, let's say you're at that end--you're at *that Merlin* end--and I was just like, "You know what, screw everybody. Life sucks, I'm not going to go to college, I'm just going to listen to punk rock and be whatever." Well, you know, part of that I was from Florida and just hadn't had enough exposure of enough stuff to realize that life wasn't worth living for. But the thing was, it wasn't until I went to college and learned some stuff and learned that, you know, there's that whole Howard Gardner thing about, you know, the different kinds of intelligence? That was certainly a totally *foreign* idea to me, where I thought that because I had failed two classes as a senior I was *doomed* for the rest of my life. So, you know, don't shop that stuff to me and act like it's something really exotic. I don't think you're going to meet that many people--I mean, I literally... I failed *ocean science* when I was a senior. I failed music theory. I *failed* music theory. Dan, would you like to know why I failed music theory?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Because I wouldn't write a march. Owing to the fact that it was--in my words--"gay".

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: I wasn't going to write a march and I wasn't going to write a Waltz. A Waltz is in three–four time, and three–four time is gay. I won't do that. No, not gay in that way. But, you know what I mean.

Dan: Yeah, back then that's what we used to call things that we thought we didn't like.

Merlin: I mean it in the Louis C.K. way. Yeah. Okay, so, Oh yeah, so I'm this guy who was born on third. No. (laughs) I had a very impoverished childhood and I almost failed out of high school. There's *not* like a great ending to this. But I'm just saying: I *get* that. So, then let's go to another end of the spectrum: Let's go to somebody who's like really, really good at what they do and has lots of horizons. Let's go to somebody who's like--not even a Steve Jobs character--just go look at anybody you admire, who's kind of interesting, and think about how seldom they sit around and ask permission from people to do *anything*. You don't necessarily even have to be arrogant, but think about the people you really, really, really admire at work. Think about if you *like* your boss. Or you like somebody. Almost everybody at a job, you've got somebody that you turn to, like if you need advice, kind of like a mentor person.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: Think about that person. It's probably somebody who's a mix of being very talented, very--

Dan: You.

Merlin: --diplomatic--

Dan: You. You.

Merlin: No, no, no, no, no. I mean somebody who's actually has jobs and stuff. But being talented and being diplomatic and being all these things, but also those kinds of people they sometimes quit jobs. And you go, "Oh my gosh, you can't leave here. (whispering) You can't leave here! Janice, if you leave I don't know what's going to happen."

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Right? Right? And you think like, that the whole company's going to leave. Well, that's because Janice knows when it's time. Right?

Dan: Mmm.

Merlin: Janice? Boy. That's a shame for you, but *Janice* knows when it's time.

Dan: The other person knows that it's time because Janice is leaving, and they don't want that. That's what that resistance usually comes from.

Merlin: It could be. But I'm just saying, well maybe Janice has her expertise and her independence have been moving up--somewhat, maybe not at the same speed, not at the same time--but, almost kind of like, not like steps: You take one left foot then right foot, but think of it a little bit that way. Like, let's say you go out and you're just a complete idiot like I was in high school, well, I had nothing. I was going to--I don't even want to get into it--but let's just say I did not have a bright future. The Marines were like running by my house all the time going, "We've seen your ASVAB, we wanna give you a job!" At the point when like the Marines are coming and telling you to come drink coffee and watch videos, you know, you don't have a super-bright future. (laughs) It wasn't Brown. It was not Brown.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: It was not Princeton. Um, I just think--what am I trying to say? I'm trying to say that the independence and expertise issue, for me, means that when you go out and you do *stuff*, of any kind, when you actually do stuff. Not when you just sit around in school, like not when you just *think* that you're learning about something, but when you go out and work. And, I mean, let's start at a really understandable, normal kind of low level: If you go out, and you don't even have to have a CS degree. Let's say you've picked up just enough PHP to go out and get a job. Well, yeah, you're not going to get to do super interesting stuff. You're going to do the equivalent of swabbing the decks, for a long time.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Because you don't deserve any better. You haven't *done* anything yet. You're just a jerk. You're an idiot. You, like, you haven't made anything yet. Like, why would somebody--well, no let's stop right there. Have you not met people, especially via the Internet, who have derived their entire sense of their expertise from the fact that no one has yet told them how little they know about something. This all tracks very heavily to this idea of the [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)--I'm stealing all of it straight from that. But it's *true*. But it *is true*. Think about it--and there's the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect)--right, there's all these people running around going, "I know a lot about everything." but *they've never made anything*. But they're full of entitlement, about all of the things that they see other people having. All they see are the people who get all of the stuff that they didn't get. All they see is the people who got all the breaks that they didn't get. You know what I'm saying?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I *see* that. *So much*. And every time I hear that character of yours, I don't hear it as like an attack on me. All I hear is, "Meow, meow, meow. Nothing's fallen in my lap yet. Meow." And I'm just saying, I sat around waiting for something to fall in my lap for a long time and it didn't go great. I got really, really, really lucky because I was surrounded by people who hadn't given up on me yet. But, I just don't think that's necessarily something that you want to just rely on, to be the governor for how your life's going to go. Right? I'm not saying you've got to go out and be some kind of Tony Robbins character, but, the building expertise--if you go out and let's say you're that PHP guy, you start making stuff, you start shipping stuff. Even if you have like a tiny role in something that shipped you could ask for more interesting work. And if you can demonstrate that you've got the skills to do that, then you'll move up. If you don't, you won't. Right? 

Merlin: "Oh, they're mean. There's politics." Okay. Good. Go get another job. "Yeah but--" Yeah but what? Yeah but what? Yeah but what? What couldn't you ship? Right? Like, every time you hear yourself coming up with all these reasons something couldn't happen: *Stop*. Like, stop saying that. Ask yourself if you're just an idiot. Because there's probably something more you need to know. Maybe you're not independent because you don't deserve independence yet. You know? And again, I understand: *You've* got your reasons. Everybody's got *their* reasons. But, you know, William Carlos Williams became one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century while he was a *physician*. He wrote on the--the one reason his poems were short, was because he wrote on the back of prescription pad, tear-off--prescriptions. You know, I mean, he did pretty well with that. You know, Einstein worked in a *patent office*. I know these are all famous stories, but I'm just saying. It isn't like Einstein showed up at the patent office and goes, "Well, course I haven't invented relativity yet, I work in a *patent office*."

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: "Oh, Fermé. Look at Fermé. Oh. Oh. Oh, Edison's great. Oh, elephants, really? *Fancy*" Except he'd do it in kind of a German accent, probably. Um, as you get better at that, as you get the expertise, you're going to *notice* stuff. You're going to *notice*, first of all, that there's all these losers sitting around whining about how they never get to do stuff. Well that's going to give you the independence to go, "Hmm. We sure are getting a lot of chum, instead of sharks, in here." I wonder if I need to go follow Janice, and go to a more interesting place? Right? If you're good at what you do, you also, on some level, have an Okay idea of how good you are at it. And yes, yes, the Dunning-Kruger effect is apparently a real thing--Google it--and yes, yes, you should all read this Dreyfus model of skill acquisition stuff, yes. What I'm saying, in a nut, is if you *think* you're an expert at something, but you actually *suck* horribly at it, and you've never been around enough people to tell you how bad you are at it, like, a podcast is not going to help you. So if you *are* really, really good--and I know, Doctor Drang yells at me, "Why are you always yelling at me. I'm a talented guy."--and it's like, "You *are* a talented guy. This isn't for you." Just so you know, Doctor Drang. But if you are somebody out there who's going like, "I don't understand. Why are my horizons so limited?" Well, why don't you first start with a really soul-searching idea of how good you are at the thing you think you should be acknowledged for.

Merlin: It really is--let's get back to the Buddha and the clarity at that point.

Dan: Okay.

Merlin: Because you may not have the independence yet--we gotta ditch--you may not have that independence yet because you don't have the expertise. Right? So, then, here's the other thing: Once you get that, you go, "Okay. Oh, wow. I understand *exactly* how good I am. None of my requests for salary raises any more are going to end with a question mark." They're going to end with, "Hi. Right now I make ten thousand dollars a year and I want you to give me twelve thousand, but I also want you to give me car." I'm making this number up, obviously. "Oh, no, we can't--" "Well, Okay. Here's the thing. I know that I can go out and get a job for fifteen thousand--I don't want to, I want to stay here because I really believe in this, and I believe in this team and I know, there's this guy here, who's not as good at me and who's probably making a little more than that, but you need to keep him on for political reasons, but you *need* me here. And I *want* to be here. Like, I *need* you, I want to be here. So let's just do this thing." And, they go, "No." And you leave. Because you *know* what you're worth. *Or* you never do it in the first place: You keep your powder dry. You keep your mouth shut. And you keep your head down until you find something better. If you're good, you know, if you're *really*, *really*, *really* good, you wouldn't have the job you've got. You'd be somewhere else. Probably. Unless you really are, like, running a team at Google, you're probably not the best at what you do. So first of all, be aware of that. And once you do have the independence, you *can't help but get more expertise*. Once you've had that taste of independence you start opening your eyes a little more and you start realizing that you're not undermining your boss by reading a book about something else. You're not--by going to a conference, by having job interviews, you know?

Merlin: You know a friend of mine that works at a place here in town--famous for movies about Star Wars and stuff (laughs)--she's went a job interview and she was like, "I feel really bad, because I don't know--" And they were like, "What do you mean? You're an adult. You should be doing this every week." So that's the thing, is once you get that independence--Oh, this is good. Dan, will you capture this?--independence influenza?

Dan: I like that.

Merlin: Yeah, it's not very good. But once you get that in your blood, it's going to be hard to go back to--it's going to be really, really hard. You think it's hard to see your way to the top just by dreaming and riding a cloud? Boy, wait 'til you've had a bit of independence. It is *really* hard to go back. And you will fight tooth and nail to never have to do that again. That's all I'm saying. So, to address the Dan character, to address the That's Fine For Merlin? Well maybe that *is* just fine for Merlin. In which case, you're wasting your time here. Like, not wasting your time, I hope you enjoy this. I hope this is a fun show. You should listen to all of Dan's shows. But like, there's never going to be a point where I go, "There, there." Why would I say that to you? Why would I say stop trying? Why would I say I don't *believe* you can do this? I'm never going to say that. Because I don't know you. But I assume you can do it. I assume you can do something more. You know? There's so much stuff, that we could just tweak a little bit, that could make us so much happier. And one of them going, like "I've gotta get out of this thing, where I'm twenty years old and I think the world's never going to change and I haven't gotten my black-belt yet." Like, I think that is such a dead end. And, Dan, first of all, the high school thing? I'm with you. You would not believe the stink-eye that I get from parents every time I meet somebody who's in high school and *in front their parents* I say, "Just so you know, you know high school is bullshit, right?" And they're like, "Yeah, yeah. Yeah." And I'm like, "Well, no. No. But I mean, your parents are telling you it's like the best years of your life." And they'll go, "Yeah, yeah."  And then I'll go, "I'm Sorry—you should probably not hear this part." I'll be like, "Seriously. Keep your head down, don't get stabbed, don't get arrested, but *get out*. Get out. I promise you college will be better." Or whatever. *Anything* but high school will be better. They're crushing you right now.

Dan: Yeah, really.

Merlin: They are crushing you. No. It's not you. You think you're crazy right now and you're not crazy: They are crushing you. Those are a bunch of broken people who are trying to take you down. Just *get out of there*. And the parents don't like that. But I agree with you: I felt the same way. I felt exactly the same way. And at the time I really didn't have ears to hear (sighs) the kind of stuff that I'm talking about now. You know what I mean?

Dan: Well there are also very few people *talking* about it this way.

Merlin: Well, let me ask you this—I'm gonna take it and turn it—that character, however you perceive that person who's saying that—and you know, be as generous as you can be about it—what would you say to somebody who goes, "Oh, that's fine for Merlin."? What's *your* answer to that? Rather than, "I can kinda see that point of view." What are you going to tell them to do differently, now that they've made that insightful realization that it's fine for me?

Dan: Well I—

Merlin: What should they be doing more conservatively that's going to protect them.

Dan: Well I don't think it's that they need protection. I think what people, a lot of the time, they hear this stuff and I think they want to know—and by the way, you *do* way after I ask you the question, which is why I ask you—they want to hear how they can actually apply it in—and I get a lot of email. I get a lot of email from people who will say, "I love this show. It's a great show. Thank you for asking Merlin this question because I *do* want to apply these things." And for a lot of people they can't make the jump from A to *P*, or A to *Q* or, you know—

Merlin: Okay. You know, I understand. I understand. I apologize. I apologize. Now. Do you code in Rails?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Okay. But, how do you erm—the classes?

Dan: Yes.

Merlin: How do I do that?

Dan: How do you—

Merlin: No, no, no, no, no ddddsta. Specifically. How do I do classes? Like, how do I make a class right now?

Dan: You would—You want, like the step-by-step thing?

Merlin: I want you to tell me—Dan! Listen to my question: I want to make a class in Rails. How do I do that right now?

Dan: Okay. You would—

Merlin: Oh, no. Well, I mean, like. Here's the thing. I want to make more money, so I'm going to get into computer programming. And I'm tired of hearing all this stuff about having to like go and like—I only have so much time, because I'm really busy and I need something very specific about this—Okay. Let me ask you a different question. 

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Can I buy a controller? Do I need to *buy* a controller? Or can I make a controller?

Dan: You can make one.

Merlin: Okay. Okay. Alright. Now, if I have, like more than like five controllers is there like a discount? Or, can I get partial credit because I've been to community college? Like, when—

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: No. It's not funny, Dan. I want to get better at this. So. Let me ask you this: Okay. If I've got, like, something like a 'Hello World' dot PL. And it's like seven, five, seven. Why is that not running in Rails?

Dan: So you're saying that I'm asking you for specific examples—

Merlin: (sighs) I'm telling you it says 'hello world dot P L'. Why wont it run in Rails?

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Should I make it six, seven, six?

Dan: Well, I'm telling you that a lot of people they can't always make that jump. They *do* need someone to walk 'em through it.

Merlin: (sighs) You can't run that because you're trying to run a Perl script in Rails. There's no answer to that question that is going to make you happy, because you're asking the wrong question. And if I sit here and go, "That's an *excellent* question. I can see how that's hard for you. Wow. That sucks. *Really* that won't run? Oh my God. Oh my God. That's *awful*. And what did Merlin say? Merlin tried to tell you—Oh my goodness."

Dan: Do you mean to say that you don't have all the answers?

Merlin: No. What I mean to say is that—

Dan: You don't have every answer for every person?

Merlin: No. No. I mean I have *an* answer that I can give to anybody. If I sit down with anybody and we have a beer, I'll do anything I can to help you. I'll do *anything* that I can. But—again, I'm coming back to something at the heart of this, which is my very perfunctory understanding of the Dreyfus model, which, again I learnt about this from Andy Hunt, I talk about it all the time, because it's completely changed the way I think about stuff. And at the heart of it is just this notion, that it's hard to obtain any kind of external skill, right? Like learning Rails, or doing whatever. It's really hard. It's hard because—for one thing, just the nature of knowledge, not to get all epistemological—but nature of knowledge is that it's hard to know what we know and what we don't know. To quote, there's that wonderful Donald Rumsfeld thing about, you know, what did he say? There are the unknown knowns and the unknown unknowns? It's *true*: When you're starting out in something you really don't know *anything* about it. But just because you know the *name* of it, doesn't even make you a beginner. Just throwing a word around, like Rails, doesn't mean you even understand anything about it.

Dan: Mmhmm.

Merlin: I don't understand anything about Rails. I'm literally throwing around words like 'Controller' because I spent ten minutes playing with Rails ever. You know, I did the David—whatcha-ma-call-it thing, with the TextMate—make a Blogging engine thing. Which is amazing. Best screencast ever.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: But what I'm trying to get at is that that is the nature of expertise: Expertise is something that is cumulative, it is something that builds up. And if you approach it from this emotional stand-point of going, "You're the dick, because I'm not regarded as, like, a Rails master." Well, no. That's so wrong, it's not even right. How many times have you gone to a programmer, and you ask them a question, and they say, "There's no answer to what you just asked me." And you go like, "What do you mean?". And he says, "Well you know that model you just asked about was discontinued in—" And you go, "Oh, God! Why don't you just *give me the answer*?" And it's because that's how, for example how a programmer thinks, they think very much in terms of—first of all you're losing of credibility, that are completely at odds. Well no. I'm actually being pretty cool with you because I understand that this is hard stuff. I understand that not everybody can do it. But what I'm trying to get at, at the heart of this—at least I *think*—is that to develop that expertise you're first going to have to A) own up to the fact that you—that none of us know as much as we think we do, but that B) the only way you're going to be able to answer this level four question is to *really do a lot of work* at the first level, and then do a lot more work at the second level. And yeah, you can think of it as faith, you can think of it as trust you can think about it as anything. But I'm not going to let you fly this plane until you show me you can drive to the airport without wrecking your car. And then yelling at me because you keep flipping it over is not helping.

Dan: Mmm.

Merlin: Like, I'm asking you to demonstrate the perfunctory skills of an adult who understands the complexity of these issues. And the complexity of these issues is nearly infinite, as far as I'm concerned. What is an easy way to say there's no one answer? Is there an easier way to say that? I mean, the kind of restless curiosity and desire to learn new things, and the desire to *be* wrong and the desire—that curiosity doesn't come from a five-bullet list. It comes out of going, "Oh, I get it: This is complicated. Now I'll go work." Right? And I understand, I wouldn't have a job if this were easy. I don't really, have a job, anyway. But I understand it's complicated, but I don't know a nicer or simpler or more spoon-feedy way to say that in order for you to improve your life, it's really going to have to be *you* who does it. And if there's anything out there that's a button, or a list or a book and you think that's really going to change everything: Just stop. Right there. That's a great indicator that it's BS. Right? You know, there's that throw-quote about being—what does he say—be cautious about—could my fact checker, please check this?—beware of any enterprise that requires new clothes. You know? It's like New Year's resolutions, you go, "Oh, I've decided I'm going to try and lose five hundred pounds by February." Which is, you know, of course first of all, totally implausible, second you have no infrastructure in place for how you're going to to support it, C) you really like to eat and are kind of a lard-ass and so all these things line up to make that a very difficult thing, but *then* you could yell at the calendar, for saying that's not plausible, but I didn't change the material facts. I haven't changed the material facts about anything in your life. You've just spent time listening to a podcast. That has not changed *any* material facts. The material fact is, that if you want to get good at stuff, then you're going to have to go really learn *from the inside* how that, whatever you want to get great at, works. You don't get great at guitar by buying magazines. And you don't get great at running by buying running shoes. These are not just—I'm not just *saying* those words, it's really true. Do you know what I mean, Dan? The part that I get frustrated with, and I don't really know how to say this is, the inspiration you *need*—first of all, inspiration is never going to make you good at anything, you know? Inspiration can get you over the hill, if you're struggling. Like, if you're working really, really, really hard, well there's an element of expertise, that says, "Okay, well I should know how to unlock myself from this problem." That's a big part of being an expert at anything, is having solved a problem many different ways, so that you know how to try different keys in different locks and you can figure out what to do. Whether you're a writer, or whether you're an architect, or whatever it is, there is the independence factor, surely, of saying well I'm going to have to—a la, Veen, talking about, well sometimes I've gotta go on Facebook to find these answers—there's going to have to be this certain amount of agency about saying "Well, what do I *do* to figure out how to fix this?" But you don't even need to worry about those problems if you haven't learned the basics and if you haven't solved enough problems that you can legitimately blame the world for this not working out yet. There's really—you're not important enough to have a cabal out to get you, like let alone me. This is not happening—there's probably *not* a cabal that's out to get you. There's probably just a pretty good chance that you just haven't distinguished yourself yet, if you're struggling *that hard* at whatever it is you're trying to do. I don't know. Dan, let's get specific: Come up with some character, or some version—a persona—let's try to help *one* make believe person. Give me a persona, when you think about that persona, who is it? And what are they struggling with?

Dan: Okay. I think, well, and we're out of time, but I'll do it anyway. Um. I think of a lot of times a person who was in the situation that I was in, say ten years ago, you know, you're working in a cube-farm, you're frustrated because your bosses don't take your ideas seriously, you've done everything you can think of to do to share the ideas and you're starting to get that feeling that, you know, these people aren't going to make any changes and, yeah maybe I'm not as experienced as they are and I haven't been working as long as they are and I haven't paid the dues that they've paid. But, some of theses things might really work and they might be really cool, and if they would just let me do them I might not want to quit. And you have to go in, because you can't get another job right then, for whatever reason—who knows what the details of that are—but you feel kind of stuck there. And you feel kind of helpless and not able to really make the situation better. Now in my situation I would quit and just deal with it. And I would never bring anything from home to the office, or decorate my desk or anything and that way I felt like I could—you always know when somebody's about to give notice, because their desk is suddenly really clean and organized. And I quit so many jobs that I just never bothered to do, because I didn't want to drop any hints.

Merlin: That's good.

Dan: But in that situation, I mean, that's the kind of person that I feel like, you know—we didn't have the Internet the way it is now, ten, fifteen years ago. We didn't have this. We didn't have the kind of networks and social communities that you can. So there was that very much, that sort of like, "Man. I'm like the only one around here that gets it." But I think that's still out there. So. You know what I want from you, when I ask you those questions? You know what I'm really reaching for?

Merlin: No. What? Yeah.

Dan: I'm reaching for the Merlin character who—and you've already done this this episode, so I don't think we need this exercise as much—but I'm reaching for the part of you that says, "Dan, there is no answer to that question. But I'm going to say something inspirational."

Merlin: Mmm. Alright.

Dan: That's what I'm looking for when I ask that question.

Merlin: Mmmhmm.

Dan: I'm looking for something that you can take and you can say—because I believe there's two sides to your answers—

Merlin: I have—Oh my gosh—I have *so* much inspiration—Dan, I could inspire you. I could inspire the heck out of you.

Dan: I know. And that's what I want when I ask you that. So there's two sides, there's two Merlins, to this. There's there's the Merlin that sort of *has* the—Oh, you're going to have to remind me: Who was the philosopher that talked about the perfect chair? Was that Aristotle? You know the one I'm talking about?

Merlin: Probably Plato.

Dan: Plato. There is this perfect definition—

Merlin: The form. The form—

Dan: The ultimate form. The ultimate shape of a chair. And everybody's always sort of—so there's *that* Merlin. And then there's the Merlin who says, "Well, on the ground in front of us we've got a couple of two-by-fours we've got a hammer and some duct tape and, you know what, you can make a chair that's *good enough*."

Merlin: Yeah,

Dan: And those are the two Merlins. And most of the show is the first Merlin, and at the end I try to bring in the second one.

Merlin: I think that's a great idea, but I wish I could talk to that Dan that you just described, because he's got a lot of problems.

Dan: Oh, yeah.

Merlin: Right? He doesn't need to worry about two-by-fours yet. I mean, I'm just telling you as somebody who has finally gone in and had conversations with the kind of people who are being brow-beaten by their employees to just have a chance to do something cool one day. Well first of all, when's the last time that you went to somebody else in your company and asked them what *they* wanted to make? Right? I don't care what level you're at—let's say you're even—you're a *team leader*, you're kind of a lance-corporal level—like, when's the last time you went to anybody else and said, "What can I make for you? What do you want to make?" Well *everybody* has something they want to make! Like, that's not hard. Everybody's got ideas. But if you're going to run around to your boss—and I'm sorry, you *need* to hear this—if you're going to go bug this boss about, "Waa! Waa! When do I get to go make a cool project?" Well what have you ever *done* that was that great? They're going to go put *their* job on the line and they're going to go spend resources so that you can go, you know, *make this thing*, at a time when they're having to lay people off? Well, you know what? You know who they're going to give that to? They're going to give that to somebody who *already made something great*. Maybe the guy sitting in the cube next to you, because he never had to go and ask permission: He wasn't looking for a *dad*. He was looking for somebody to basically just do an introduction to say like, "I obviously should be working at a higher level than this, because look what I made." Yeah, you're right, let's go. You don't go to people and *ask* for that stuff. It's like, I mean, I agree with you, Dan, and I felt that same way too. But just because I felt that way doesn't mean I needed to be talked out of it. I thought my Mom was a dick for not letting me play in traffic. I could not *believe*. I was like, "Do you understand how much cooler it is, out in the street?" And she was like, "I *do*. I completely understand. But there's a lot of cars out there, and it's my job to make sure you don't die." And I'd be like, "You are *such a dick*! Like, why would you—you're constantly going on about this don't play in traffic stuff. And I've gotta tell you, Mom, it's a non-starter for me." And she'd be all like, "Well, I need to really make this clear to you that you're not going to go play in the street."

Dan: (laughs) Right.

Merlin: "So, I can explain it to you, and you can understand it, or I can not explain it to you and you can not understand it. But you're not going to go in that street. Because whether you understand it or not is not material to the fact that you will *die* if you play in the street." Okay? So, what I'm trying to say is there's a *lot* of people out there that are going to go, "Hey! You know, if you think it's going to be good. If your life-meter says that you should go play in the street, follow you bliss." I'm just going to say, "Get the heck out of the street!" So, yeah. As far as the inspirational stuff, Dan, you know what? I am fine to dedicate whole episodes to the inspirational stuff. But here's the problem:—there's always a problem—like, in the last quarter—not even in the last year—in the last month: What's the last great thing you made this month because of inspiration? Send it to us. Send it to Dan. Something you would never have made, except you got *inspiration*. Because I think that's B.S. People either make things, or they don't. Inspiration is a poster. I'm *sorry* but—go ahead, send it—show me the thing and then show me what inspired you. If you're pushing out product all the time—if you're pushing out five projects out a week, you might get a sixth project through inspiration. If you've never pushed out a product in your life, or a project in your life, inspiration is *not* going to help you make the first one. *Working really hard* is going to help you make the first one. That's the problem. Inspiration is great, but there are so many people who are inspiring you—like, you spend so much time getting inspired that when do you ever actually *make* that thing that impresses your boss? And says, "Sure I'll give you a budget for that. I'd be an idiot not to." That's what concerns me, Dan. It concerns me that there are so many people at every corner who realize that their bread is buttered on the side of telling you BS that makes you feel empowered, instead of going, "Wait a minute." You don't need some kind of robot with big teeth telling to go buy a book. You need a big brother who's going to go, "Wait a minute, you're not ready for this yet. You have not demonstrated the expertise that you need for your yellow-belt, let alone brow-beating me about why you haven't gotten you black-belt." I'm just saying, if we go back to that very first or second episode—remember the everybody's got their reasons? I mean, start by thinking about what other people want, too. You know? If you have a project you want to do find somebody who's already working on a project. Find out how you can contribute to that. You notice how much of this stuff comes back to the I, I, I. Me, me, me. why am I not getting this? Why am I not getting that? Why is my boss not stepping up to bat for me, to make this easier for me? Well that's not your boss's job. Like, your boss's job is to impress *their* boss. You're just an operational detail. They've got stuff to do too. Right? And the way you—again, not just the way you become the CEO—the way you impress the CEO is by shipping three things where they go, "Wait a minute. How did I not hear about this?" What you want to hear people say about you is not, "Why is this person still here?" What you want to hear people say is, "Why did it take me this long to tear this person out of this department and fling them higher up the ladder?" I mean, I think, I really believe that. 

Merlin: You know, Dan, finally I know we're super late. You could make this ten episodes. The last thing is this—and this gets to take a little of my own medicine—let's talk about problems and levels. The kinds of advice that is going to be useful to people is going to vary a lot, depending on their level of expertise and their interest. So, I mean, one way we might want to address this—in the next episode—is to talk about, Okay: Let's say you *are* at the absolute beginning level, or lets say you *thought* you were an expert but you realized you're really just an advanced beginner. What are the kinds of things that you can think about in terms of—maybe with a tech-spin—but what are the kinds of things you could do to get better at this stuff and to, depending on your situation, to develop the genuine increases in expertise and independence that will make it unavoidable to other people to move you up. You know? Again, if you go back to that, "everybody's got their reasons" stuff: Well there may be a reason that everybody is getting promoted around you. I mean, I don't know you, that's not addressed to you. But, do you know what I mean, Dan? Like, you have to really go look at the reality part and—finally, I will say if people want to write you with specific questions about this stuff, I am *happy* to contribute whatever I can. We're talking to a lot of people here, Dan. We don't *know* any one person here. But all I can do is say the truest thing I know about most people, which is when they stop worrying about what other people are giving them and they start worrying about what they're able to produce for themselves, your vision changes so completely that you're going to hear the words of being that Dan Benjamin character and you're not going to believe those words ever came out of your mouth.

Dan: That's what I wanted you to say. Right there.

Merlin: Alright. Boom!

Dan: Boom!

Merlin: I love you.

Dan: Love you too.
