# Back to Work
## Episode 1 - Alligator in the Bathroom

Merlin: Well, given that we had this idea yesterday--I think this was yesterday afternoon? I thought we should call this "Back to Work"

Dan: Love that.

Merlin: Mmhmm.

Dan: Now where did you pull that from, that name?

Merlin: Um, like everything good, I think it has two meanings. I mean there's always that, "Ha Ha! Merlin's a jerk", thing of, "Ok, you got your tips, now go back to work", but what I really like is--you're a Buddhist Dan--If you really want to get back on the path, all you've got to do is step back on the path, right?

Dan: That's right.

Merlin: And I think, for reasons I think will become apparent--I hope will become apparent--I'm really interested in how you figure out how to get back to the work that means a lot to you. Right?

Merlin: So, we all get derailed--so who said this? Somebody said this; I love this quote: "It's not a question of not being scared, it's a question of being scared and not doing it anyway". I mean, almost everyone has said that, but it's true of your work, too. Any time you're not doing the stuff that matters to you--and there's certainly a lot of stuff that you'll have to do that's just stuff, as Michael Lopp calls it, "stuff and things", but that doesn't mean--a la the first pancake--it doesn't mean that we shouldn't keep getting back and moving forward with this stuff.

Merlin: I like the title! You think it's dumb? I checked the iPods--what is that thing? The company that makes the things? I went to their store and I didn't see it on there. Have you seen a "Back to Work", is there a "Back to Work"?

Dan: No. No. I think we're it.

Merlin: We might need to call it, "Back to Work UK", like they had to do with Wham. Like English Beat, they used to be The Beat, but then Paul Collins already had a band called "The Beat". So. Back to Work.

Dan: Back to work. With Merlin Mann. I think we have to credit you in this. This is really your--as much as I'm here, and a part of the show--this is coming, a lot of it is coming directly from your brain.

Merlin: First of all: Can we just stipulate that every show will not be about putting our heads up each others ass and talking about how nice it smells. We're not always going to do that.

Dan: Well that's how you sold me on the show, though.

Merlin: Well, I did. I said relax, just have a little bit of meat and sit with that <SOMETHING> nice and tight in there, and then just really focus, act like you're really focusing air right on the sphincter, as hard as you can, but not in a mean way. So, I think, to tell you the truth, Dan. I like doing podcast stuff, but there's a reason I stopped doing The Merlin Show, and there's a reason--it's hard for me to do. And I like the stuff that you do *so* much, and I really like--Oh, God! Who's that guy with the weird hair? Is it "Grubby"? What's his name? "Grubber"?

Dan: John Gruber.

Merlin: What's his name?

Dan: *John* Gruber.

Merlin: I'm not familiar with his work. But he seems like a really mean guy, and a bit of an alcoholic and you seem to keep him on an even keel. He doesn't really talk like that. When you're with him, he sounds more like some kind of a puppet that somebody dropped. And you keep him sounding like somebody who's not out of his mind, and I need you to do that for me.

Dan: We'll work on it.

Merlin: Seriously. I'm serious. Well, we should talk about this at some point, but, I like the idea of the Back to Work, because I think what you're doing with the 5by5 stuff is desperately impressive, high quality, polished stuff that'll make me better and I think the timing is good.

Dan: The timing *is* good. *And* you've kind of been laying low for a while, which is relatively for you laying low.

Merlin: It's like that guy in the movie where he had to eat his arm. I mean, you could call it laying low, but I really had a large unfinished pile of papers sitting on top of me, which made it *very* hard to move. That's a book. So. Which I'm still working on. You know what? This is part of the show, right? It's all related.

Dan: Yeah, I'm not editing any of this.

Merlin: Yeah, I'm not worried. All we need now is a little ukelele sound. But, I think, it's a lizard brain thin. I think you can get so wound up in this one thing that you're supposed to be feeling bad about, that you lose a lot of opportunities. Get ready folks, there's going to be all kinds of this Hippy crap.

Merlin: I really believe that. So what am I going to do? I'm going to sit around and feel bad about my book being done? Or I'm going to feel better about making something that's really cool, with you. Even though you're in Florida, which is kinda weird.

Dan: Yeah, Florida is a very weird place. And it's especially weird this time of year.

Merlin: Can we round back around to Florida? Because I have a lot to say about Florida.

Dan: Yeah, definitely.

Merlin: Yeah. So, what do you want out of this thing?

Dan: Well, you know, I think for me--this is the true part that's going to make you feel a little uncomfortable...

Merlin: Gaaaad.

Dan: ... That's a head's up. I'm going to do this again...

Merlin: Do you do this with your wife? Does she have to sit through--Your child, does he have to sit through all of this bracketing?

Dan: Oh, he definitely does, yeah.

Merlin: Oh, God, Dan.

Dan: You want me to skip it?

Merlin: No, no, no. I just don't want you telling me I'm going to be uncomfortable.

Dan: You're going to be. Because I'm probably your number one fan.

Merlin: I'm not made of candy floss.

Dan: Well, you're my number one fan.

Merlin: No, *I'm* your number one fan.

Dan: *I'm your* number one. I've got to get this straight.

Merlin: Right.

Dan: I'm *your* number one fan.

Merlin: (softly) Thank you.

Dan: And ever since we talked on The Pipeline, one episode of that, and I think you were on a couple episodes of The Conversation, and I love all the interviews I do, but those were some of the most fun ones to do, and every time I'm like, "Yeah, this is the guy that I have so much fun--and this is the guy who talks into his thing like it's a phone".

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: Was it a wallet? Or a shoe?

Merlin: Yeah, yeah. What's fun is that a lot of people look at those--it's called "That Phone Guy"--and a lot of people look at those for years and somebody has to point out to them that it's actually a wallet, which is kind of the funny part.

Dan: I *like* that.

Merlin: Something I started doing in the mid nineties, because, it needed to be done.

Dan: I just remember seeing that, I'm like, "Who is this guy?", you know?

Merlin: Well thank you for saying that. As I said in my douchey post on 43folders, I feel the same way but different about you, because like I said yesterday, in our marathon phone call--and this *does* relate, I think, to what we're talking about, and it also relates to the stuff that--what's his name? Grubby?--Gruber and I talked about at the South By Southwest, which is you know, you sit around and you go, "Oh, I hope people *like* me and I hope they *friend* me and I hope they do all this super official stuff that doesn't cost anything". But what you really want, is to like, not suck enough, that people you really admire wouldn't mind doing something with you. And if that sounds like nonsense, then, like, you know, change the channel in your Mom's basement. Because that's the thing--the whole thing is getting to where--I'm not saying you get to go work with George Clooney or something, which I would really enjoy, but you know, just getting the opportunity to have yourself and your work improved by proximity to people who are better at what you do. That's what it's about. It's like the liberal arts. You don't get to go, "Oh, I like science, so we have to change history." No. You want a well rounded class, not a well rounded student. And when you get the right team, you compliment with each other--with two 'e's--and so anyway. I'm really glad to be here. I hope it's good. I'm going to try harder than I usually do at things, because I really want this to be good.

Dan: Well that means a lot, and at the same time, I think people are really excited by these kinds of shows. Shows where people like you, who have so much really interesting and novel in many cases, experience. There are so many people who are going to be listening to this, I think, who are dying to know, what goes on in your world. And you do live in a very kind of unique situation. I mean, think about it, you live *in* San Francisco, you're at the centre of all of that great stuff that the rest of us are thinking, "Wow. How cool would it be to live right there and be in the centre of it", and you get to go on all these speaking things that you do and everything else. I just think it'd be great to take some of that back and not have to be lucky enough to be one of the companies that can bring you in to hear you talk.

Dan: And, *not* pigeon hole you into one certain topic, and say, "Oh, well today we're going to talk about--you know--this new iPod".

Merlin: I'm really grateful that you find it that theoretically interesting, because it is nice to be here. It's a fine enough place to live. But, I mean, a theme for me, that I have trouble getting away from--who said this? I think it was Gruber who said this, "everybody's got a boss", you know. Bono has a boss. Everybody's got a boss. In the sense that there's always something you want, that you don't have, and there's always somebody you have to please on some level. And that doesn't have to be an actual boss, but for the sake of our discussion, it's not a bad way to look at it. I mean, I've got a boss too. When I go out and talk to these folks--and let's be honest, I almost never, ever, ever, ever get rehired by a company, probably because I'm not very professional, but also because my biggest benefit, if they hire me and give me a *ridiculous* amount of money to talk to them, is I stand there, and a lot of times show them that the people who hired me are a big part of the problem. And they don't like that. It's not your workers that are the problem, it's yours, you know.

Dan: So what do you talk about when you go to these places?

Merlin: I will tell you, but let me finish this one thought, just because it is important. I mean, for me when people--the corollary to that though--is the people who do think that, "all I need is more power. All I need is more money. All I need is more San Francisco". And just so you know, there's not a treehouse. There's not like one place where we all hang out here. At least that I'm aware of. Maybe they haven't told me, because for obvious reasons they might not want me there. I mean, the way that I think about this--and yes I say this in talks--as soon as you see somebody who's got something you don't have, well A) it takes trade offs to get anything. Like, there's stuff I don't get to do. Or, you know I'm just saying everybody does that: If you want to mow your lawn, you can't go to the movies. It's not complicated. But at the same time, the higher up you move, or the more responsibility, or more cool anything, the more interesting people you begin to disappoint. All you do is increase the number of people who will generally be bummed that you're not doing something else. And there's going to be a bunch of people out there who go, "that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life", go ask the CEO of your company. Do you think the CEO of your company just gets to sit around and like blow balloons all day, and like do bong hits? No, he or she is heavily indebted to stakeholders, that include a board, that's very demanding. Right? It's just, I think this gets directly to the theme of what I hope we get to talk about a lot, which is barriers. I don't know. Actually I have a story about that.

Dan: About barriers?

Merlin: Yeah. It's a story about why I called you yesterday.

Dan: Alright, so tell us. So, for those who don't know, and actually only you and I know because this is the story that happened. I told you after we did The Pipeline interview; I said, "shame on you for not doing You Look Nice Today more", and then you explained how it really is a production, there's a lot of editing, it involves three people so there's a lot of moving parts, and I just said, "the world needs more of you on a podcast. Let's do a show. Let's do a new Merlin Mann Show". And you said "Ah, well you know, I don't know, I got this going on, I'm writing a book". That was almost a year ago. That was darned near a year ago, because I've been doing this for--it'll be like a year next week.

 Merlin: And then I didn't even answer your very nice email about just being on your show. Like a total jerk, I didn't even answer your email.
 
 Dan: Right. You would not answer the email and then you would say, "I'm sorry I dropped the ball, I didn't answer your email, I don't really do email, I'm so busy right now, so I'll be on your next show", and then this show day would come and go and I'd say, "OK, well, we were supposed to record today at 1, where were you?", and, "Oh, I thought you meant *Pacific* time", so we didn't do it again. So I just thought, you know what, this guy's just too busy were never going to do it. But that's OK, I did have these couple of great episodes with him, that were really fun to do. The download counts on those episodes were off the charts, you know what, when he wants to do something then he'll call me. So then, yesterday, or the day before--I forget 

Merlin: No, it was yesterday. It was yesterday morning.

Dan: I was in the kitchen, and I was checking email on the laptop in there and this email came in from you and I  read it, and I looked up and I said to my wife, I said, "The email that I've been waiting for for a year has finally come."

Merlin: You know, you're not--Buddhists aren't supposed to lie.

Dan: That's not a lie. That's what I said.

Merlin: Now it's two lies, you know?

Dan: No, and she didn't know what I was talking about, and I told her and she said, "Wow! That's awesome." And the email was basically you emailing me saying, "let's do a show."

Merlin: Mmm. Is the chat room lighting up, with people going, "what is this show about? Apart from Dan and Merlin complimenting each other."

Dan: Well that really is all this show is going to be. No, they're not. They're--people are saying, that they like You Look Nice Today, they're calling you Mister Inbox Zero, good--nice things. They're saying, no they don't care, they're just happy that you're here.

Merlin: I'm going to shut down your compliments, because it's starting to give me--I think in medicine they call it an erection--here's the thing...

Dan: I told you it'd make you feel uncomfortable.

Merlin: Yeah, but here's the thing. I'm not going to curse. Like I'm not gonna curse on this show.

Dan: That's right.

Merlin: So. Yeah, it's gotta go somewhere.

Merlin: Um. And that's my blood flow. So. Ah. I'm just going to tell you. There's this guy I like a lot who is--I don't love this word but he's a "deceased" guy--who when he was living was a writing coach. And not a writing coach in the sense of, "Blah, blah, something something, write every day." His name was Donald Murray--Don Murray--and he was actually a coach--he was a coach of reporters and journalists, but more importantly he was a meta coach. He taught people how to be writing teachers, which sounds recursive, but it's really not. Because his whole thesis was that we teach writing poorly by trying to teach this backwards process, or to quote him, "it's like trying to infer a pig from a sausage." And instead you have to have this real, certain amount of ridiculous, unnecessary, stupid, unwarranted, undeserved, courage about just diving into the middle of wherever you are. His thesis being that writing is a constant process of looking forward and back at the same time. You're never really just revising, it's not one iteration, from draft to publishing. It's hundreds, and hundreds of iterations. And once you accept that, if that doesn't make sense, go write. OK? Sorry, that's the way this works. Once you start writing, and you really, really, really write, you will go, "Yes. This explains this. This is what you do." And he's been so inspirational for me. And not just in that, go buy a poster of a boat kind of way, but in making me say, "You know, I can really do this." And there's so much about what he had to say that I find really inspiring, and as I mentioned right before we went on, I don't know if these numbers really stack up because I haven't got into writing as a thing, but he says that when you get good at writing, when you go pro, you can think of it as a pie graph. There's a certain amount of time, on what you might call "pre-writing", so a certain amount of time that I call "drafting". And another amount of time, which is revising. Again, there's a lot of iteration and overflow. But he says, once you get really *good* at writing, the amount of time you spend typing the draft might be five percent. Which sounds crazy? Right? Because, you watch movies, where people type and that's writing.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: Well, what he says is that once you get good enough at it, there's a lot of sorting thinking and percolating, again to work on multiple projects--just to let your brain do it's thing. And then, you just sit down and go, "OK, here it is." And yesterday, I went, "OK, here it is." Because I just realized that this is stuff, if you can't see my bust a gut posts on 43Folders, this stuff really doesn't matter to me, and so I think I want to try and cross the Rubricon, to try and get from somewhere between douchebag advice about like, you're a jerk go work harder, versus a list of 135 new ways to update Chrome. Somewhere in between there is a sweet spot, and the struggle that we have with finding that sweet spot in our work is the same struggle that we'll probably have making this show appeal to everybody, which it wont. (laughs)

Merlin: Does that make any sense?

Dan: It does.

Merlin: That's why I called you and that's why we were both so excited about it. We were like, "we don't even know what this is going to be, but let's do this because I think it will be good." I mean after this one episode, it'll be good.

Dan: Well, I think a big part of it though is that you talk about things like the creative process, you talk about things like inspiration and I think that those are the kinds of topics that people, regardless of what their field is, whether they're building webpages, whether they're a designer, whether they're you know--writing briefs every day--where you draw that kind of inspiration from and how you get to work, how you actually go through that creative process to create something. Because it's actually pretty easy to feel inspired to create something, but it's very hard to actually *do it*, for a lot of people. For most people, I would say.

Merlin: Mmm hmm. Yeah, it's funny. When I finally got treated for ADD, I would tell my doctor, "Oh, yeah, I used to drink a lot of coffee, and do this and do that." And he said, "Well, you know, when you're doing that -", sorry I'm going to paraphrase this--sorry, Tom: You are really emulating the effects of successful normalcy or medication when you do that, right? When drink a lot of coffee, it doesn't *feel* that different from taking Adderall or Ritalin or whatever--Cetera--or whatever? Yeah Cetera, whatever that medicine is called.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: You know, I started taking Peter Cetera, because my Doctor told me it was hard to say he was sorry. I think it's called "Strattera". But, the point being, that you know, you're just getting all of the superficial effects without any of the actual change. And, this is what happens in what I consider this culture of sort of buying berets. You get that little dopamine shot of having made something, even though you haven't really made anything. Because the actual making of stuff, ends up being a fairly tedious process, a tedious, lonely, non-beret wearing process. And I'm not saying that in a *mean* way. I hope I'm saying that in a hopeful way. Because, as hard as it is--and I'm not talking about me here, I'm talking about *real people* who make stuff--as hard as it is to get great at making stuff over and over again, there is something oddly freeing about saying, "Well no. There is not a genie. And there is not a muse". And it will take you more than four hours a week, and you can't do it in a hammock. You're going to have to actually get up early and work. No one in India will do this for you. That's a subtle reference. But you're going to have to go out and really work on this stuff. If it matters to you. And if it doesn't matter to you, then a beret will be fine. But, to get to the nut of this, if I may: So this is what really finally made me actually say, "Here, Dan. Now." And I was drinking, which I don't usually do, but I was with a guy who likes to drink--a friend of mine, who actually happens to be a client--and we were talking about what we're both really interested and fascinated by, which is culture. What is it that makes some environments such a petri dish for great stuff? And what is it that makes people want to run away from the petri dish, like stealing office supplies and like you know peeing in somebody's desk. What is it? What makes that difference? What is it, and can you change it? Right? And in time, I found myself moving more towards this position--as we had more drinks--more towards this position of saying, "Well, you know, it kind of doesn't really *matter* what other people do." Given that, ultimately, you're the one who's gotta be mi animus. You're the one who's actually going to have to go, "Shit." Right? And my sense was that--great guy--but he kept moving further towards, "Yeah, but, this person does *this*, and that person does *that*, and I need this to do *that*." And I found myself saying, "Well, OK. But what? What are you going to *do* as a result of that?" Do you just give up? Do you just spend all of your time trying to fix what these other people are doing wrong? And to get to the nut of the nut, apparently, I'm told by the security guards who removed me from the room, that it ended with me basically yelling over and over, "What couldn't you ship? What couldn't you ship? *What* couldn't *you*... ship?" And then he'd go, "Well, (mumble)", that's what I heard anyway, you know, "Something, something, blah blah, ginger." And they go, "Oh, that's a really good point. Ah. So. Mmm. Err. Ahhh. Nngh nngh nngh." So, what couldn't you ship? And you know, he'd been drinking too, so maybe it was just hard. But the funny part was, I think it was good for both of us because, I think it was a really hard question to answer. And if we really, really are honest with ourselves, there's not really *that* much stuff we can't ship because of other people. And so, to me, that's what I want to talk about here. Not, *why didn't* you ship? But, *what couldn't* you ship? And, you know what I mean by that, right Dan?

Dan:  I think so. What was your answer to him?

Merlin: I didn't have an answer, because the answer was- I mean, think what I was trying to brow beat him with, and I'm prepared to be wrong, but what I was trying to brow beat him with is--back to your original question, right? I always use the jokey phrase, "boiling the ocean", well that's what it is. Like, when are you going to get enough change in other people to satisfy you? When are you ever going to get enough of exactly how you need it to be to make one thing? Well, you know, that is *always* going to be there, you're *always* going to find some reason to *not* run today. You're always going to find some reason to eat crap from a machine today. You're always going to find a reason for everything. To quote that wonderful Renoir film, Rules of the Game, something along the lines of, "The trouble in life is that every man has his reasons." *Everybody's* got their reasons. And the thing that separates the people who make cool stuff from the people who don't make cool stuff is *not* whether they live in San Francisco. And it's not whether they have a cool system. It's whether they made it. That's it. That's it. End of story. Did you make it? Or didn't you make it? And so, what I hope we can do here, is talk to some friends of mine, some of whom you folks are familiar with, and many of whom you're not, and talk about how this shipped. (laughs)

Merlin: I told you an anecdote yesterday about a friend of mine with a beard, that some people know, and a turning point in his life when he had to carry T-Shirts in a box around Scotland.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: And I want to talk to him about that. I want to talk to my friend with the beard--who actually apparently lived in the woods of Vermont for a while--talk about how his career changed, when he had to carry T-Shirts around Scotland. I got a really nice email from another friend of mine yesterday, who's making a really cool funny show about a hospital, with kids (laughs). And I want to talk to him about how he goes from just being this guy in Boston to, like, being a guy that makes a thing that *delights* people. And how many things you've got to *not* do, to go do that thing. If we could get him, I'd love to get Louis C.K. on here. I don't think that's going to happen, but, do you know his deal? Do you know what his deal is?

Dan: No.

Merlin: His deal is, they give him--I want to say three hundred grand per episode, which is not a lot of money for a TV episode--and he has reportedly one hundred percent control. This is a guy who threw out his entire act a few years ago and started over, I think he's one of the funniest comics--he's a comic's comic--a *very* funny guy. He threw out all of his materials and decided to write a completely new, *from scratch*, show every year. Which would be a little like Picasso going, "I'm going to go burn all the 'blue period' ones because now I'm going to go do this other thing." I want to talk to *those* people. Not just comics. Not just Troubadours, but, I want to people who *do* ship, and then I want everybody out there who thinks they need to live in San Francisco to do something cool, to realize that we've all had to carry our own box of T-Shirts around Scotland. And the only thing that's stopping you doing that--on *some* level, not on *every* level, you don't get to push a button and have a TV show tomorrow, but neither did those folks. They had to do a bunch of stuff and then *not* do even more stuff to make it happen. So. I'm going to stop talking now. But that's why I did it, Dan, because I want people to think about what they couldn't ship, because of *whatever*. Because of their pen, because all they have is iPhone 4, because they're really curious about how this whole Android-Verizon thing is going to shake out. *What couldn't you ship?*

Dan: But in a way it almost sounds like you're just talking about the regular, human mental process of procrastination or making excuses.

Merlin: Yes. I think procrastination is--but that's kind of like going, you know, well, I almost made a poop joke: I'm not going to do that on here. Um. Procrastination is an effect, not a cause. In my opinion.

Dan: What's the cause?

Merlin: What's the cause of procrastination? Really?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Um. This is the hippiest thing I'll say on here today. It's when you temporarily forget who you are, or who you want to be. It's when you forget what you're supposed to be paying attention to. And, when you lose confidence about what your options are for doing something about it.

Dan: But don't you think that distraction plays into that as well?

Merlin: Why?

Dan: Because I think *today* it's very easy--if you think back, I'm not talking about when we were kids, I'm talking about to generations prior to us--when the only thing that you did on a Sunday afternoon was watch the gross grow or go invent something.

Merlin: Right.

Dan: You know?

Merlin: It's true. But I mean, you don't masturbate, right?

Dan: Of course not. Never.

Merlin: But you've known people who do that right?

Dan: I've read about it.

Merlin: Um. Does anybody need to set an alarm to masturbate?

Dan: I would assume not.

Merlin: Well I don't know. We should ask. We should ask your folks in your chat room.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: What about video games? Do you need a reminder to play video games? Do you like a special distraction free video game remembering?

Dan: Certainly not.

Merlin: Well no. No let's take it a step further. What about Facebook? You certainly don't want to let that go fallow. Do you have to remember to go pick up your zombies, on Facebook? Do you get like? Is there a web service that can help you remember that?

Dan:  There probably is a few.

Merlin: If you can do all of that stuff you're not really distracted. You're not really distracted. You're only distracted if you think one thing is more or less important than another. Well every minute costs the same. Every minute of your life costs exactly the same. And when you know what you care about, you quit making excuses about being distracted. When you care a lot about writing, you can do it on the back of piece of a napkin, and then say, "waitress, could I please have another napkin." You don't need anything except the desire to do it. And if that sounds like BS, then you probably haven't written anything. That's the problem.

Dan: OK, so how does the fear play into this? What about fear of failure?

Merlin: Well we can get to the fear, but let's be honest about the distraction stuff. I'm not trying to be reductive about this: Yes, distraction is an issue. Yes, I like to write in a really plain text editor. But--this is where the paradox and the lizard brain stuff starts to really creep in--I think what's cynical, is marketing a product as being a quote "distraction free writing" environment and implying that that's going to help people write more. Because I can't think of a single person I know who writes substantially more *because* they have a distraction free writing environment. Now, I don't doubt that that happens. *But*, it's like they say in skiing--I don't know if this is true--but supposedly, in skiing, there's only two kinds of people who need the poles: beginners and pros. And for everybody else in the middle, you don't *really* need the poles. I don't know if that's true, but it's a great metaphor. The same is true here. You need the armatures and you need the compensatory muscles to do exactly what you need to put your ass in a chair and move your hand. That's exactly what you need. If you need a distraction free writing environment, to write, then you really need to ask yourself if writing is what it is that you want to be doing. Scott Burkin, who's written some wonderful books on project management, has teed of a lot of people with what I would consider some of the best advice about writing ever. Which is, when people go, "Meow, meow, meow, how did you write a book?, Meow, meow" He goes, "Well I wrote a book by sitting down and writing a book. What's the next question?", (in whiny voice) "Well,  it's so hard about.. it's so hard..." Well, if it's so hard then, like, maybe you don't want to write. Is it that hard to masturbate? Well you manage to do that. You like your video games--you've gotten really good at *that*, you're a fourteenth level sitting down guy.

Dan: (sniggers)

Merlin: So. Not to be cynical about it, but you're not allowed to play both sides of the street on this. It *is* paradoxical. It *is* hard. It *is* almost impossible, all this stuff. But when you care enough about that stuff, you quit sweating the impossible and you focus very heavily on the stuff that provides a contribution. So. Sorry, fear.

Dan: Well, there's fear, but you've made me think about something else, which is the issues of prioritization.

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: You know where I'm going with that.

Merlin: Sure, sure.

Dan: So what's the answer there? There's a lot of people who *have* obligations, who have things that make it difficult for them to set aside the time. Maybe when they say, "it's hard." maybe what the mean is, "it's hard to find time to prioritize what *feels* like work, even if it's enjoyable, over these chores I have to do--over these dishes that are in the sink."

Merlin: Obligations. Pre-existing obligations. Right?

Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: Your son--not to get personal--is just a little bit older than my daughter, I think, we've talked about this?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: So he goes to the playground, right?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: If he gets hit in the head with a swing and is bleeding, do you have time to deal with that?

Dan: Uhh. You *make* time, right?

Merlin: Well, I don't know. You should check your list, right?

Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: No. Prioritize. That's what you should do, right? You should say, "Hang on, Joel, like sit there--don't... don't--Daddy's busy." And then you pull out a list and you check it--and his screaming is *certainly* not helping, the bleeding is *very* distracting, it's *very* distracting to do your work when your child is bleeding--and so, you know, the thing is what he doesn't understand is, the importance of prioritization. Because you've got a *lot* of obligations: You need to put off podcasts, about Android, and I don't think he always gets that.

Dan: (laughing) Right.

Merlin: OK. So my kid falls down. I don't pull out a list: "Oh, that's really about *urgency*, it's not about importance." No. It's about, like, I have a pretty good idea, like, what's not allowed to be hurt and what's allowed to die. And when you say--this gets us to an interesting and nuanced point, but just to finish this one thought--when we talk about all of these things that aren't allowed to move, because of priority, that is so frickin' ironic to me, or so paradoxical to me. Where it's like, you know: Do you remember [the show we did, with Veen?](http://5by5.tv/conversation/27) Where we talked about working on your own, and stuff like that? You brought up this point--you're always being, like, the heavy-set guy who eats cookie dough and wants more tips on running. You're always representing that viewpoint in a really sweet way. And people go like, (whiny voice) "I don't *understand*, like, how can you be independent?" And it's like, how can you *not* be independent? You know? It's like, the way you be independent is you decide you're gonna go be independent. Like, do you imagine that you go to, like, a store and get a magic carpet and suddenly you get to be independent? Well, no. You become independent by saying, "Now it's time for different priorities." When I became a *dad*, sorry, there's a bunch of stuff that didn't get to be a priority anymore. I don't get to just do stuff now. I don't mind that, because I kinda like my daughter. But do you follow? 

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: So when people--the problem is, that's the irony of this, that's the whole, like, it's like The Matrix. Right? If--not Neo. Who's the guy with the glasses? What's his name? Fishburne's character?

Dan: Lawrence Fishburne? The character he played...

Merlin: Chat room. Chat room. Real quick. What's his name?

Dan: The chat room's going to have to do, because...

Merlin: Red and blue. Red and blue.

Dan: ... it's been too long since I've seen...

Merlin: Not, Neo...

Dan: Morpheus.

Merlin: *Thank you*. Morpheus.

Dan: See, I got burned on that movie after the second--I can't even look back at the--it's the same thing, with Lost: The last season ruined it for me.

Merlin: Oh, I know. It's like. Yeah, for me it's Weezer.

Dan: I've kind of, blocked out...

Merlin: It's Weezer in the mid two thousands. (laughs)

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Maybe we should reevaluate? No. I love Weezer. Hi, Patrick.

Merlin: No, But. Um. The Erh. The thing of it is, if he just went around in a truck--like ran around in the mystery machine, like with a bullhorn, yelling, (shouting) "Hey. Hey everybody. THIS ISN'T REAL. You're living in a pod! With lime jello. Providing electricity for *robots*"

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: How successful would his campaign be?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Because people aren't ready to know about The Matrix. Right? And, so, when you say to somebody, "Look, I am *so* thirsty. Can I drink that salt water?" You go, "You know what? That's kind of a bad idea." But they go, "Yeah, but it's *water*.... *Idiot*"

Dan: But here's where we come back to the...

Merlin: And we go, "No. Dude. It's salt water. It will literally--the more you drink of that, the worse this will get." And when you go, "Ah! Priorities! I've got all this stuff to do." Well then, here's the thing: You have to figure out what you *can* do, at *what* level.

Dan: Do you ever feel scared?

Merlin: *I feel scared every frickin' minute of the day!*

Dan: Because I think, for a lot of people feeling--it seems like you embrace that fear. But for a lot of people, they want to *avoid* the fear.

Merlin: It's a totally natural impulse. But has avoiding the fear ever kept bad stuff from happening to you? Is that your inoculation, to go like, "Oh. I'm going to close my eyes. I'm forty years old, but I'm going to close my eyes and not being scared means nothing bad will happen." The universe doesn't *care* whether you're scared. Like, stuff's going to happen to you. Right? And, again, back to this lizard brain: sorry get used to it. (laughs) It's like, if you think that makes a difference...

Dan: OK. OK. Hold on. Hold on. Stop, stop. Explain the lizard brain. I know what it is. But there are a lot of people who don't know who Seth Godin is, who haven't heard the term.

Merlin: Oh God! Oh. God. I like Seth. But don't credit him with *that*. (laughs)

Dan: OK. So where does the lizard brain come from?

Merlin: Ahhh. The Limbic System? Your body? No. In a nut. Let's avoid all the neuroscience and talk about the metaphorical version, which is that, based somewhat in the idea that our brain evolved to keep us safe from bear attacks, there's a lot of stuff that kinda kicks in when we get scared, or when we feel threatened. And this can happen on any number of levels. Obviously, if you've ever been *mugged*, you know that feeling of sweating really hard and breathing and wanting to poop. Well, every animal poops right before it runs. Right? It breathes really heavy, right before it runs: It's called 'Fight or Flight'. And it's your body having to make--everything becomes intensified. You ever been in a car accident? And it feels like it took a month, for the accident to happen? That's because your brain slips into a different way of processing information. It's taking in a huge amount of information about what is the next threat that is likely to harm you. This is not me. This is science and stuff. So. The problem is that's great for a bear attack: If you get bear attack annually you're in good shape. The problem is, most of us, because of bad habits and because of bad cognition--in my opinion--have now made that the way we look at stuff. And basically, everything is a bear. And so that can manifest itself in a million ways, but the way I see it manifesting--so, they call it the lizard brain because it is based--we've talked about this on The Pipeline--but there's this book that I haven't read, called [The Triune Brain](http://www.amazon.com/The-Triune-Brain-Evolution-Paleocerebral/dp/0306431688/5by5-20), that's *extremely* long, and one model of the brain that's--some people disagree with--but one model of the brain that there are three of the major divisions in our brain, are based on sort of like this lizard part, this mammal part and this human part. You know? In other words there are parts of the brain that we share with our lizard ancestors--not *exactly the same*, you know--although I do like Dinosaur Train, it's a good show--and then you've got this other part, it's about the mammal part: the dog brain some people call it. And the problem is, when we get scared we don't want to write a poem. When we get scared we don't want to feel empathy toward the bear. We don't want all these dog and human things. We go straight into: I'm going to poop, to make me lighter. I'm going to breathe really hard to get more air to circulate the blood. And then I'm going to tear ass. Which is great for a bear attack and not so great for a phone call. Not so great for an email. Right? Linda Stone has talked about this, 'email apnea', people tend to hold their breath when they're doing email, unconsciously. So here's the thing, with all of this stuff: If you only work one set of machines at the gym, you shouldn't be surprised that one set of muscles develops to the exclusion of others. Hence, the guys with the giant torsos and the stick legs. Right? And if you only work the muscle that says, "Being scared keeps me alive.", not only are you going to lose the chance to do a lot of cool stuff, and not only are you going to strengthen the habit that is probably most damaging. You're also going to develop--in my opinion--a new kind of cognition that looks for information related to bear attacks, rather than looking at the number of times that there were no bears there at all. And to me, that's a habit. It's like running. It's like any of that stuff. It's like you just go out and do it. And, like I say, it doesn't mean don't be scared. And let me just be super clear about this: You can play this angle in a way that I think is actually really instructive, Dan, and useful, of like, (southern accent) "Well, what about me? I'm a guy with a mortgage and stuff" And it's like, well yeah. So, you know what, don't buy a book about four hours a week, that's not a smart idea. That's your lizard brain going, "There's a genie for this" Well, there's not. But you know what there is, even if you're working like sixty hours a week, can you take half an hour a week, to update your resumé? Could you take fifteen minutes a week to read a magazine, from a trade that's not your own? Could you spend forty five minutes a week installing Rails, from Dan's tutorial, and picking up enough Rails to have a new skill? The answer is not, "I'm just going to sit here and be scared.", and that becomes a consolation. I think the answer is, how do I run straight into that crap storm, let it cover me with crap, but not let it stop me from running. So. I don't know if that makes *any* sense to somebody with a mortgage, except to say that we *all* have limitations, and we *all* have to shed stuff to do that. So maybe you don't get to get drunk with your buddies at Hooters every week. Maybe you don't get to go to a professional sporting event. (laughs) You shed that, and you go, "Well. I'm going to have to go work this muscle I don't like working to get good at this." You know? Like, what do they call it? 'The Adductor'? 'The Taint Machine'? You know? It hurts your taint? Like you've been roller skating? Like that's the machine--you don't want to do that machine--but that's the machine you need. "Your muscles are fine, Jonny. Sit down and work the taint!" (laughs)

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: I don't know if that makes *any* sense, Dan. I speak in metaphors and that's bad.

Dan: You're sort of like, you know how Doctor Phil has all those slogans? You're like the Doctor Phil of this space. You know?

Merlin: (laughs) I know exactly *one* thing about Doctor Phil. *Exactly* one thing. And that is when his show first came out, they had one, you know commercial for it that I guess Oprah paid for out of pocket, that ran constantly. And all I remember is this one part where he goes, (Dr. Phil voice) "You're gonna *need* a Doctor tonight." 

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: That's all I know. Everything I know about Doctor Phil is him looking like somebody just hit him with a sock full of pennies, going, (Dr. Phil voice) "You're gonna *need* a Doctor tonight."

Dan: (giggles)

Merlin: So, that was to a husband who just didn't get it. You know? What's his schtick? What is his deal? Give me Doctor Phil in a nut. What's his deal?

Dan: Ahh. You know, I think he has that sort of good ol' boy kind of--these Southern expressions, and he's got an expression for everything--just like you do: "There's a genie for that" Or "Everything's a bear", "A beret will be fine". I mean, all of these things, like, where do you pull those from? Where do those--did you write them down when you think of them? Do they come to you as you're speaking?

Merlin: (Dr. Phil voice) "Here's the thing, Dan. If you wanna find the treasure, you *gotta* buy the chest. Okay?"

Dan:  (laughs) That's right.

Merlin: (Dr. Phil voice) "And can I tell you another thing? You don't win at tennis, by buying a bowling ball. Alright?"

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: (Dr. Phil voice) "Now, if you wanna live in a tree, don't be surprised if you're livin' with monkeys."

Dan: Right. Where do these come from?

Merlin: Capture that. Capture that one! That's pretty good.

Dan:  Those are good. Where do they come from?

Merlin: I don't know. I forget to pay the electric bill, but I can make these up in my sleep.

Dan: Do you think that your--let me see how to word this--do you think that your prolific ability to think the way you do, makes you think that other people have this capacity also?

Merlin: (pauses) That's a really. A question that I was not prepared for. That's. I. Think, probably, kind of yes. Because I've never gone wrong in life assuming that somebody is smart. I've gone a lot assuming people are dumb. Yeah, you may not have the same kind of stupid jumping from topic to topic mind that I have, but. Um. Ahh. How do I say this without sounding unkind? I don't have a lot to have a lot to say to people who aren't trying. Personally. And I don't have a lot to say to people who want a three bullet outline to understand something as simple as, "Go work." And so I could be a lot clearer, and I often am. If I'm sitting there with somebody who's a busy SVP and the success of my visit depends on them going, "Oh. He told me one smart thing." If you want one smart thing, I'll give you that. But I think, part of this, there are plenty of people--God! I hope this show is not always just talking about us--but there are plenty of people out there to tell you the same thing. Whether you're like, (whiny voice) "Eeargh, Merlin's a jerk on Twitter.", or whatever. Well, there's plenty of people that pretend to like you on Twitter. Like you'll get that. You've got that. There are plenty of people to tell you you're fine, except for not owning this book. And there's plenty of people to tell you, "All you gotta do is: foo." And they're not being honest with you. They're telling you things because they think you're stupid. I'm sorry, that's why they're doing it. They think you're dumb. And they think you're not up to doing what they've done. And it amounts to a Ponzi scheme. And it's not cool. So. I kinda don't care if this doesn't always make sense. And I kinda don't care if you don't like me, because I don't need you to like me. I need you to love your work. And I need you to love you family. And I need you to love the stuff that matters. And if I don't always give that to you in the way that works, then there's plenty of other people that can. I'll tell you what I'm *never* going to do is try to slice and dice this into small enough pieces that you don't have to be bothered to chew. 

Merlin: Does that make sense, Dan? You're in Florida, but you're pretty smart, right?

Dan: Ah. I am in Florida.

Merlin: Have you always been in Florida, Dan?

Dan: No, no. Philadelphia was where I was born and raised. We moved down here.

Merlin: Oh, *that's* the connection.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: (whispers) That's the connection.

Dan: Explains being an Eagles fan, for sure.

Merlin: How long have you--we should explain, that we're both kind of from Florida.

Dan: Yeah, you're from Tallahassee, right?

Merlin: Eventually, yeah. But I went to junior high, and high school on the Sun Coast. A place no one's ever heard of called Newport Richie. And I went to college in Sarasota and then I lived in Tallahassee...

Dan: Is that *New* College?

Merlin: Mm hm. Yeah. Now it's called New College of Florida, but but back then it was just New College. And then I went to...

Dan: Ultimately you don't actually have a clear degree or something. You make up your own curriculum, you work with a professor and then you...

Merlin: Yeah. There is just literally, literally nothing there. You show up and there's not even dirt: You have to make your own dirt. And then you have to build a hut. It's a lot like Lost. You come in, there's no books, you have to write the books. You have to actually build the professors out of things you can find, usually palm leaves and something that tourists have left behind. Maybe art by John Chamberlain, the gifted artist. You build what ever you can find and that's--no. We don't have any of that. It's a combination of like Reid, meets Santa Cruz, meets basket weaving. But it's a good school, but it's very unstructured. And I had to beg and beg and beg. It's like a 13--like a 1350, 1380 average SAT and I barely got in. But it was an amazing experience, because to this point no professor there doesn't get paid if you screw up. Nobody really *cares* if you do the work. Like, they don't--if you cheat, like, bad on you, but like that's OK I've got plenty of other people to pay attention to who are good at this and care. And, some people--some people, the stories were, we were right next to, actually on the same grounds, like between--this is so metaphorical for the school--we were between the grounds of The Ringling Brothers--John Ringling's house and Charles Ringling's house--and on the other side was the airport. And people would--apparently there's a story of at least one person who never made it from the airport. When they found out there were no school colors and no athletics, they just turned back around--I guess they called their Mom on the Wall Street portable phone and said, "Fly me home." But what was neat for me was--again, it's a liberal arts school--that's all it is. You have to--Oh, I'm just telling you this because it is *kind* of germane--you gotta go make up your own curriculum in some ways, you have a sponsor, you have serial evaluation. So everybody goes, (douchey voice) "Oh, you don't have grades?" No. I get a four page evaluation on how much my worked sucked. I'd rather have the C plus thanks. And then you do a thesis, that you have to defend to a Baccalaureate committee, independent study, blah, blah. But it's a place where I could go in, and in my first semester, organize a seven week seminar on reading every novel by Kurt Vonnegut. And then he took us out to breakfast when he came and spoke on campus, which was one of the best mornings ever. That's an experience you're not going to get at a giant school: Kurt Vonnegut taking you out to breakfast and signing with a butt hole in your copy of 'Slaughterhouse-Five'. It was pretty great. Um. So. Sorry, I derailed us again.

Merlin: Yeah. Florida. So. What age did you start in Florida?

Dan: Like, early teens.

Merlin: Oh God. Brutal.

Dan: Yeah. It was tough. It really was tough. I went back to Philly a lot during that time when I first moved here. And then less and less as I got older. It's been tough, living down there. Especially South Florida. I mean that's--South Florida is its own *thing*.

Merlin: They say the further South you go in Florida, the more like New York it becomes.

Dan: That's true.

Merlin: Tallahassee, I mean. I was like twenty miles from where James Brown was born. Like. We were right, just South of the Georgia border. I don't know. I mean--I know I'm being reductive about this. When I was kid, Dan, Texas was always the crazy state: It was Texas, where you know they, where they--whatever, make people into (incomprehensible) or baths, or make em a lamp, or bones in their house or something, you know--Ed Gein kind of stuff?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: But it seems like Florida really has taken the mantel of crazy away from Texas.

Dan: Well, I think the further away you get from the coastlines and certainly the closer you get to Georgia, that's true.

Merlin: (laughs) Hi, Georgia! I don't know.

Dan: If we had any listeners they're gone now.

Merlin: Yeah. Yeah, well. I'm not going to say anything. It is funny though, because Florida--it's funny how that has effected both of us. Not necessarily *bad* ways, but the environment that you come up in--I don't know--such a long lasting effect on the way you think and see things. You know? So you went to high school? You went to junior high and high school.

Dan: Yeah, I just don't think that I could ever live in--like, I've visited San Francisco and I *love* it and it really does feel--maybe this changes when you're living there, maybe this changes when you're there every single day, maybe it doesn't--but I always feel like it's like an electric place. Like, you really feel like stuff is going on, and the average person in San Francisco, who doesn't even work in technology, you know, you get a sense that they *know* something. You know what I'm saying?

Merlin: (laughs) Yeah. Yeah.

Dan: Just walking around that place. Like you walk around that place and like the homeless guy who's...

Merlin: It feels challenging. It feels kind of challenging.

Dan: The homeless guy, who you feel a little nervous around, has more Twitter followers than you do.

Merlin: (laughs) Erm. That could be true, in some instances. I mean, you  know, I like the fact that we're always going to see this slightly differently, I think that's instructive and useful. A phrase I'll be using a lot, probably. But, you know, I mean, what's funny to me is, to the Florida-ish point, I just think it's really interesting what  you grow up thinking is normal, and what you grow up thinking is your horizon. You know what I mean?

Dan: Mmm. Yeah.

Merlin: I don't know if that makes any sense, but, I don't mean to--at this point, seriously, honestly, I don't mean to like, diss on Florida. Because a huge of this was that I was just a *slacker*. But it's funny, because I think about being a kid in San Francisco, or Oakland, or anywhere around here and you've got *BART*. You've got this train, that runs really late, where you can just *go places*. I don't know about you. Would you say that you've always lived in the shadow of the mouse?

Dan: No. Well, no, we lived in South Florida and then I went up here to central Florida for school and then we moved out to North Carolina for a while. And by the way, just for the record, we *are* moving. 

Merlin: (surprised) Buh?

Dan: Yeah. We're moving away. We don't have a destination that we can talk about yet. I'll tell you after the show.

Merlin: Where'd you go? UCS? Or FIU?

Dan: UCF

Merlin: Sorry, UC*F*, yeah. Huh.

Dan: Go Knights.

Merlin: Is that knights, that's the knights as in the armor and jousting? I like the idea of a team with a collective noun. You know, it'd just be the UCF Knight. It'd be a collective. You know what I mean?

Dan: I do.

Merlin: Like, The Blaze, or something.

Dan: Yeah. They didn't do that.

Merlin: No. It's a little abstract. I always think it's funny--because I've talked about this before, but I--Well, so, anyway to finish that thought, though: In San Francisco, and I don't know if everybody utilizes this, but we've got Streetcars, that take you around and, I mean. So. If we wanted to go to Vinyl Fever in Tampa, which is where we always bought our records, and, you know, we'd have to get in a car and drive for, like, forty five minutes, which is kind of cool because it had a certain intentionality to it. Same where you lived right?

Dan: Yeah. Everything is a car ride. Everything is twenty minutes.

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: Everything is twenty minutes in a car. You want to go to the Target? Twenty minutes in the car. And those are the kind of destinations I have now, they're not the Vinyl Depot, or whatever you said, they're Target and Home Depot and Whole Foods. And all of them are twenty plus minutes in a car.

Merlin: (laughs) It's funny you should say that because, you know that phrase 'NIMBY'--you know, not in my back yard -

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Um. One of the wonderfully, just ridiculously, hilariously--I mean--just hypocritical things--I mean, to me there's two levels of hypocrisy: There's the level of hypocrisy where you're just kinda like being honest and doing stuff and there's another where you're like genuinely brow beating people about something and then doing it a thousand times worse than everybody else. San Francisco is *constantly* lecturing everyone about all of these issues. San Francisco has, I guess, a metonymy. It's just constantly going, "Hey! Everybody does it wrong!" You know. San Francisco is like having a TiVo, like, you never have to see anything you *don't* want to see in San Francisco. Because basically, the squirlier you are, the more somebody wants you to be Mayor. Right?

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: "That's great, I think you represent the earless people who like to wear fake ears while they drive a tiny car and pick up their dry cleaning really well. Also you love cats." And that's like a *thing*. And then you get a sub-group. And then you have splintering and some people want a slightly larger car, but with dogs. And that's a thing. And then that's a group. And pretty soon you're changing policy about schools because of that. Not that that's a bad thing.

Merlin: But the problem is, like, in San Francisco--Um. We're really *into* this whole, "Oh. You can't build your filthy Crate n' Barrel in such a  precious place as this corner." Like. But, like, we're totally fine with people building it right outside of town, so like we can drive our car. Right? Target. Costco. Giant-Ass Trader Joe's--sorry Giant-Butt Trader Joe's. All of those, we are totally fine with South Francisco or Daly City. It's just so funny to me, that like. It's like priorities, right? I mean, you move it and it goes somewhere else--you push it. But I hear you, and the other thing, when we go visit our family who actually lives near Sarasota, it feels like before we get anywhere near, there's like three stages: There's the stage of like getting out of your sub-division, right?

Dan: Right.

Merlin: There's the phase of then like driving, driving, driving, driving. And  then there's the phase of, like, it's almost like in Lunar Lander--the Atari game--like where you've gotta (space ship sound effects) like, then you've gotta like *ease* your way into where you will spend money. And that's like a landing procedure. But you don't just go grab milk at the bodega, that's an hour, right. If you want to go to Target and buy a lamp, that's an hour.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: Yeah. It's just a different philosophy I think, like, people who live in the city, they have in many cases, many people, especially if it's a nice city, with a fresh market with all that stuff. Like, the idea of doing what we do here, which is like, completely load up the back of our, you know, SUVs and Minivans and whatever with the food and supplies that we need to, you know, rough it in the suburbs for the next week. It's almost like, if you were going camping you're going to carefully say, "These are the things I need to bring. This is what I need for the tent. We're going to need to start a fire somehow." 

Merlin: Scarcity. But scarcity, right? It's only what can fit in your pack.

Dan: Right. And, in this case, it's only what can fit in one trip in the back of your trunk. But you're very careful, "Well, you know, on Wednesday, we're going to have such and such for dinner, so I need to make *sure* that I have *all* of the stuff that I need *now*."

Merlin: I don't think that's so weird. I don't think it's *that* weird.

Dan: Well in the city you just walk out of your apartment door, you take ten steps and you buy, "Ah, we'll get the meat here."

Merlin: Nah. We live in the suburbs. We live in the far Western part of San Francisco, which is very uncool. Very unhip.

Dan: But don't you have an office in downtown, too?

Merlin: No. I have an office right near my house.

Dan: Oh.

Merlin: But, to your point--I forgot where I read this, I want to say Heartburst--but there was a wonderful article a few years ago, that seemed really sane, about an issue that's frequently not dealt with in a sane way. But this person's thesis, as I recall, was that it's the chicken and the egg problem: You start with a big house in the suburbs, or you start with a big car, and there's a weird level of recursion. OK. remember back in the day, you weren't always a Mac guy, right? You used to be a Windows guy? Or a Unix guy?

Dan: Well I've been a Mac guy, as far as since day one I started on an Apple, but I mean, I've certainly had Windows machines.

Merlin: But do you remember '92, '93, whenever Word--I guess--seven came out? And it installed like thirty extensions. And it became very clear that as the processing power and the amount of RAM went up, that software developers were going to respond by making more and more, kind of processor-costly stuff, until now I mean opening Photoshop takes ten minutes. I'd rather open Acorn. Big-ups for Flying Meat. By the way, seriously, Acorn: Great app.

Dan: Better than the Pixelmator one?

Merlin: You know, I never got the HUD thing. I never got my head around the HUD thing. It's a beautiful app. I bought it, paid for it. Like all this stuff. But this guys thesis was, you get you giant-ass house--giant-butt house--(laughs) and what do you do? OK. So now you've got like a nine bedroom house, you've got this McMansion. So what do you do? Well you've gotta put stuff in it, right? Alright and plus, you know, little Tyler is going to be starting Soccer next year, so we're going to need something to put, you know, the cleats in.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: And so you buy this huge car. Do you see what I'm saying? Do you see where I'm going with this? And pretty soon now you need the sub zero freezer, because, you know, you've got all that *meat*. And, I think that's kind of true. I used to date a woman who's Dad lived on a boat, and it was so interesting to think about how he ran his life. There's a community here, a really cool community near here, where a lot of people live on house boats. I think that's actually where Allan Watts lived. As you'll know *his* work. He drank a lot, apparently. But people have bikes there. People have little bikes with a little basket. Because if they took the six-pound box of tortilla chips from Costco into their boat, A) they couldn't get in the boat, B) it would probably sink (laughs). Do you know what I'm saying?

Dan: Yeah. So they have to make changes. They have constraints, that are by choice, that they have to decide what the want to do.

Merlin: Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, you're on to something else. This is really dull and off topic but, I think what you're experiencing is very endemic to Florida, and very endemic to post World War Two industrial culture, which is that we kept moving West. We just kept moving out in concentric circles. Tallahassee, terrific example. There was an area in Tallahassee that was really the sticks when I moved there in 1991 and that is where they built all this new development, right? Because it was *cheap*. But then what happens? You build a bunch of hundred and fifty thousand dollar houses and what do you get? You get a [Publix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publix). Right?

Dan: Right.

Merlin: Oh! Well, now there's a Publix with a *light*. Now I don't know about you, Dan, but where my Mom lives a Publix with a light is a *really* big deal.

Dan: You're talking about the light behind the sign.

Merlin: No, no, no. A Publix with a--you can make a left turn--you get a green arrow.

Dan: Oh, with a *light*! A stop light at it.

Merlin: Don't stop lights become important in Florida?

Dan: *Oh yeah*.

Merlin: A left turn? Are you kidding me? Off of something like A1A or whatever? Like, it's *hard*. You gotta do this crazy stuff. And so what happens? People come and they use the Publix, and then they go, "Hey, this is kind of a cool neighborhood." And pretty soon that's not the frontier any more and people have gotta keep moving.

Dan: Publix is a grocery store. People in the chat room are asking what Publix is.

Merlin: Oh, sorry, sorry. Hey, do they still have Winn-Dixie's? Is that still a thing?

Dan: Yeah, but they're not doing well. Nobody wants to go there.

Merlin: It was like the filthy, barefoot crying baby store.

Dan: Yes. 

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: Like, I had to go there one Thanksgiving morning to buy something that my wife needed, and the Publix wasn't open yet and it was like...

Merlin: Ugh. It's like rats and sad people.

Dan: It was, *really bad*. It was rough. And you could tell I wasn't the only one who was in there on unfamiliar turf. You know?

Merlin: (laughs) You looked like Margret Dumont, like with your long gloves, walking through there and going, "Oh, my!"

Dan: Yes. Yeah, and people were sort of--you'd look at the other person who normally doesn't go there and you'd just have this *look* between the two of you. You know.

Merlin: (laughs) Yeah. To make that You Look Nice Today noise, "Euuuhh."

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Ahhhhhhhhhh. We're running out of time.

Dan: Yeah, this is about it.

Merlin: Constraint, Dan. Didn't we say constraint. We said we were going to try. So let's close on something vaguely related to the show.

Dan: OK.

Merlin: You know, I'm fine. Rat holes don't bother me, I have a record that's strong.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: But, what do we want to do with this? What do we want to do next? Let's tell the kids.

Dan: Well, yeah. I mean, this is the first episode. And we had an orchestrated tweet yesterday--we both tweeted at the same time, and we asked people to tune in and said, "We don't really know what this is yet either." We know we want to do a show, we know kind of the themes that we're going to be talking about. But it is very much, I think, an exploration. You know, with a lot of the shows that I do here I know what to expect and I think the audience kind of knows what to expect, and I think what to expect with this show is: Merlin's going to be here. I'll be here. And we'll be talking about the kinds of things that are interesting to us.

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: And I think that's enough of enough of a parameter--that's enough of a constraint. Plus we'll do it in an hour.

Merlin: We will. And I mean, the whiteboard for me would include things like--like I said: I mean, we have the capacity to have guests, right?

Dan: Absolutely, I can have one or two guests.

Merlin: I also think video. I think we should do video.

Dan: You wanna do video?

Merlin: I *do*. You know, I used to be against it. I think if you plan it with the video, I think people like that, it's very engaging, you get to see faces and stuff.

Dan: That's fine. The way you said it last time was...

Merlin: That's not accurate. I was talking about something else but that's not important.

Dan: Alright. That's cool.

Merlin: But the...

Dan: *What a memory you have!* It's frightening.

Merlin: No. Yeah! It's truly, *truly* frightening how bad my memory is.

Dan: No, it's good! It's good, I'm saying.

Merlin: I think guests. And by guests, I mean people you know and don't know, who have struggled with this same stuff and are sucking less at it.

Merlin: I was vaguely involved in talking to John Moltz and some people, about a conference that would be basically based on *doing* it wrong. I like the idea of having John Moltz on here and talking about doing it wrong. And I really--this is going to sound like other things I've done, because it is--but I want to talk about applications. Like, not just in terms of what's quote-unquote, "Sucking the oxygen out of the vertical.", but what we *use*. I want to talk about text editors, that's a fantasy of mine. Are you a TextMate guy? Or, what do you use?

Dan: I am currently using TextMate. I've been *dabbling* again with BBEdit, because they have recently added the ability to open up a *folder*, without having to create a project out of it. And that is intriguing to me.

Merlin: Mmm. Nice. I do that in TextMate, and it's huge. Like, the ability to grab it and drop it.

Dan: That's the thing. That's the big selling point.

Merlin: Yeah. I've been looking at Vim. I did a talk--again, again, again--I did a talk at Flickr and I talked to this woman there, who's like this huge Vim nerd. I may look at that again.

Dan: One of my friends who works over there, and he put up some pictures of you over there. I thought that was great.

Merlin: Oh, who was it? Who was it?

Dan: Daniel Bogan--the Waferbaby guy.

Merlin: Oh. Pssh. I owe him a setup, like for weeks and weeks and weeks. Daniel's such a hero of mine, too.

Dan: Oh, he's great. I wish he wouldn't take his site down and destroy it every twenty minutes. But other than that, he's brilliant.

Merlin: Flickr?

Dan: No. His [waferbaby dot com](http://waferbaby.com). The content's gone. Where is it? He takes it. He brings it back. He throws it away.

Merlin: You know Stalin did that.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: He took his site down. Everything involving Trotsky he would take down. It's like that Violet Blue deal on the Boing Boing. He just acted like Trotsky never existed. And then, I think he got a pickaxe in the eye. That was in Mexico. 

Merlin: I think, um, I don't know what it's going to be either, Dan. And I have to tell you, that's going to probably frustrate some people. But that's OK. Because I think we'll figure this out. And I want this to not always just be me talking, because I think you're super smart, and I want to know what you think. I want to talk more about Florida. Do you want to talk about applications? I want to talk about how people *do* this stuff. And I want to talk a hopefully a more empathetic way about gently looking at the stuff that's keeping us from shipping. Even if it's really not. The point is, it doesn't really matter. If you think when I was a little kid, after a viewing of Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein--don't ask me why I thought there was an alligator in the bathroom--I was four years old, I was positive. And I said, "Mom and Dad, you have to understand there's an alligator in the bathroom." And they said, "Actually, we're pretty sure there's not. We manage this apartment complex, and we're pretty sure there's not an alligator in the bathroom. Also, it's the guest bath, so it would have to be a miracle." And I said, "OK. Ha ha. *Please* get the alligator out of the bathroom." And at that point, as I do with my daughter, they thought it was *funny*. Even though, with every fibre of my being, I thought there was an alligator in that bathroom. Then it got worse, because now my parents are kind of making fun of me.

Dan: Oh.

Merlin: Right? But the truth is, there was never an alligator in the bathroom. It didn't change anything in the world. You know what I mean? And to the Buddhism point--God! My daughter and I were walking down the street the other day and you know, you don't want your kid to see dead stuff, right? Right? Do you try to keep him away from dead stuff?

Dan: Ah. Not really. 

Merlin: You're OK with that?

Dan: Yeah, I think I'm OK with that.

Merlin: She's a really--I don't want to say sensitive--she's a really *empathetic* kid. And so, you know, I've explained some stuff about when we've seen dead stuff. We saw a really cool dead gopher one time, we saw a dead bird. But there was what looked like a tabby cat.

Dan: Yeah, that's tough.

Merlin: Right. When you see a *fresh*--like this is almost pettable--tabby cat.

Dan: Right, yeah. I would steer him in a different direction if I saw something like that.

Merlin: We're walking down the sidewalk and I am wanting desperately--well number two, I don't want her to have to see this, but number one, I don't want to react in a way where she sees me flinch. Right? So I'm trying to keep away--we're close enough--and I'm like, "Oh, God. It's a wet paper bag." And I go, "Look at that! What does that look like to you?" And she goes, "It's a turtle." And I said, "I think it looks like a cat." And I said, "I didn't know if that kitty cat was OK. It looks it, but it's really just a paper bag, isn't it." And based on a conversation we've been having over the next two days, I say "Ellie, what part of your body that made me think that was a turtle, and made me think that was a cat?" And she goes, "My brain." And I was like, "Yep. That's your brain." 

Merlin: And every time you think there's an alligator in the bathroom, and every time you think a wet paper bag is a tabby cat, that is your brain. And nothing in the world changed. That bag didn't change. It didn't become a cat. It didn't stop being a turtle. Literally nothing in the world changed except your perception of that. And I think that is maybe one of the most interesting things in the world.

Merlin: At the heart of it, I think that's what we should be talking about. We should be talking to people who *thought* that something they thought was a dead cat turned out to be a paper bag. Maybe a paper bag full of money. Or maybe a paper bag full of... Ahhh.... I got nothing.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: But do you see where I'm going with this, Dan Benjamin? Are you willing to give this a swing?

Dan: Yeah. I think *so*. I think we definitely will. And we'll do this--and you've committed to me that unless you're traveling or doing something for work or something, that this will be a weekly event.

Merlin: No. I mean, not to get tedious about this. But yeah. I mean, like I said to you yesterday.

Dan: We're going to do this every week. So I just want to set the expectations. I don't want people to think...

Merlin: No, no. It's on my calendar. If it's on my calendar it happens. Don't worry.

Dan: That's important.

Merlin: If it's in email, nothing happens. (laughs)

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: No. And we're going to do this. And I think we should do the video, and we'll do guests and stuff.

Dan: Yeah, we'll do video.

Merlin: I don't have to go to Facebook or anything, do I? Do I have to go to Facebook?

Dan: Not as part of *this* show.

Merlin: Do you have somebody who can do that? Do you have like a Facebook person?

Dan: Yeah. Yeah, you don't need to go to Facebook.

Merlin: Right. Alright, but you'll tell me when I need to do something, right?

Dan: Yes. Just like always.

Merlin: Yeah. What's John Gruber *really* like? Have you met him?

Dan: Yeah. I met him one time, in person and we hung out. It was at WWDC. I happened to be in San Francisco that week for, something for work, I was the CTO for a startup.

Merlin: You're being serious? You guys have literally only met once. Is that true?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I heard you say that on an episode. You guys have only ever met *once*?

Dan: Yeah. How many times have we met?

Merlin: (sighs) Good point. I mean, I've hung out with Gruber half a dozen times. Always a delight. But, ah, that's so funny to me. Because I think of you guys as being like peas and carrots.

Dan: No. I only talk to him on the show.

Merlin: Yeah. That's how it is for me and !!!FIXME!!! Everyone thinks that all these podcast douches like live in a treehouse and it's like, no. I've hardly met anybody I've ever done a podcast with.

Dan: I think I was saying this off the air to you, yesterday or something, or maybe it was before then, that like John and I talked way more before we started doing the show. And now that we do the show, any time we get close to a good conversation one of us will stop it and he'll say, "Oh, yeah we'd better save this for the show."

Merlin: Well, let me just say Dan Benjamin, that we have not, in the past, gotten to talk as much as I would like, so I'm lookin'...

Dan: This'll be great. Yeah, because in this case, this will be much more talking than we've gotten to do.

Merlin: And, can I close--well I don't want to tell you, it's your show but, like -

Dan: No. It's *your* show. Let's close it *your* way.

Merlin: You know what, Dan. Don't--it sickens me. Stop that.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: But you know what I would say, and I hardly ever say this because I'm supposed to be a jerk on the Internet but, I would actually--if you can collect it, I don't want to have to read every one of them personally but--I would like to know what people would like this show to do. Especially if you're super smart. I would love to know.

Dan: (laughs) Yeah. Only if you have, yeah, something something. What are the qualifications?

Merlin: Here's the thing, Dan. Like, God doesn't sweat aetheism. If God exists, he then he doesn't sweat aetheism, if he doesn't exist, then he's got a lot to worry about. If you're smart that won't bug you. That's only going to bug you if you're not smart, and then I'm not worried.

Dan: So how do you want people to do this?

Merlin: What do you think is good? I don't believe in that survey retweet this kind of crap, but. 

Dan: I know you're a big fan of email: You want a *lot* of email to come to you.

Merlin: Yeah. Love that. No. It's not that. (sighs) Save it. If you *do* want to like follow the stuff on Twitter, I hope you share that and if there are themes, if there are questions is there any of that stuff? Because, like we said, this is not--we're not sandbagging--we literally made this up yesterday. And I have stuff I care a lot about, you have stuff you care about, but. Erm. We could have a letters thing, you know? People tell us what you want. Or a theme. Or like, talk about *this* kind of application. Like how great would that be?

Dan: It would be great.

Merlin:  If we could have a show on like, what? Are there FTP apps other than Transmit? Apparently. But you know what I mean, like we could talk about different kinds of stuff. I *love* your stuff, about--every time you put out a new tutorial about a new rev of OS ten, I always find myself sitting there, like "user local"? Is that your go to?

Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: Like "user local", I didn't even know about that until your stuff. I've used you as an example of how *bad* I am with the terminal. I just literally copy and paste lines from your page. I think that stuff, I think talking about the original life hacks-ish stuff that Danny talked about.

Dan: Yeah, yeah.

Merlin: Things like secret scripts, I will share with you. I've checked, I have written the worst bash script in the history of forever, and I will even share that with you so you can tell me how to improve it.

Dan: Well I also want to talk to you about things like, why you have three thousand text files, with only one word in them. Things like that. I want to learn that.

Merlin: (sighs) I've broken every iOS app I have tried. I've broke Simplenote, I have broken Elements--Hi, Justin.--and when I hit, like a letter Q, you ever do that thing? When the button just hangs there? That button hangs there for *four seconds* for me.

Dan: Awwww.

Merlin: Want to count? Let me give you a count. (typing) Hey, Dan, we have the same noisy keyboard, don't we. We talked about this. You have a Tactile Pro? You got a Tactile Pro?

Dan:  I *did* have it, but it finally stopped working. Because it was given to me by Mike Davidson, of Newsvine.

Merlin: I *love* that guy!

Dan: Yeah, he's good. And then he sent it to me, I guess because his suite-mates, or  office mates complained that it was too noisy.

Merlin: I listen to the podcasts I've been on, and I can hear this like, well you know what it sounds like, (typing) It's the noisiest keyboard. One thousand, eight hundred and ninety three.

Dan: One thousand, eight hundred and ninety three, text files?

Merlin: Yep. For a total of thirty two megs. Now, you compress that and you drop that in a zip. Well what do you do? Here's your tip for the day, you tips and tricks nerds: Ah, if you're in Pathfinder it's super easy, you could just do this as a zip...

Dan: Do you use that Pathfinder instead of Finder?

Merlin: Yeah, I do.

Dan: Yeah, I gotta think about that.

Merlin: I like that Steve, he's a good man. And, ah, I like Pathfinder. It's not perfect. If there's any way that I'm moving, quite honestly, it's towards the shell. I mean there's a lot of stuff I'm increasingly jumping into the shell for. But what's nice about Pathfinder is, ah, and my profile is all screwed up, since I got my new computer, but, basically, and window you're in. You guys know the trick? I know you know this, Dan. But you know the trick, for example, if you can drag a folder--like you type "cd space" and you drop a folder.

Dan: Yeah. You just drop it right into Terminal and it'll put it into the path.

Merlin: Yeah. Or do you know the corollary--I'm sure you know this--"open space period".

Dan: Yep.

Merlin: Not a lot of people know that. If you're in the Terminal and you hit "open space period".

Dan: It will cause the whatever path you're in, in the Terminal window that you've "cded" into to be the main Finder window.

Merlin: Finally, at minute seventy one, just as we're eleven minutes late, we get to the practical stuff. But, um, for myself it is funny. I learned this, I think, from just hearing Veen talk about it and watching him work. It's funny in the same way that--what? I mean, this is going to sound crazy, but there's some stuff I do in TextMate--a *huge* amount of stuff I do in TextMate--but that doesn't mean I *don't* do stuff in TextEdit, or don't do stuff in a web browser. And I think at a certain point the art of this is figuring out how to not have to think about that a lot, and just *knowing*. Right? And so, for me, like I am kind of increasingly jumping back and forth because I'll have a little shell script that *works*. But then something, for example that Gruber pointed to--this should be an episode--This Service. Did you ever get into that?

Dan: I am not a big fan of building services.

Merlin: But you got how that stuff works, right?

Dan: But people can make that stuff dance, and it's pretty impressive.

Merlin: Well that's because you've--if I understand correctly--you're very conversant and comfortable in the shell.

Dan: Oh, well, yeah. Like you say I find myself going to the Terminal, I find myself going to the Finder sometimes.

Merlin: OK. Right, so you grew up in green and black.

Dan:  Yeah.

Merlin: Um. Gruber pointed this a while back and this is--first of all it's services. Learn about services. Oh, and by the way, if you're a Windows guy: Sorry, there's not going to be all that here for you (laughs). But if you're a--but, uh, seriously--the services: I'm really glad that that is finally getting more attention. It's still *really* wonkily implemented. Where you've gotta go in and do ad-hoc flipping on per app, which is crazy to me. But for me, between Launchbar and services, and--in fact--services *within* Launchbar. You guys know what services are, right? You go to--is it "Apple"--You go to, now, app menu. So whatever app menu you're in: So right now I'm in the Finder.

Dan: Yeah, the app menu and then there's services with the little right arrow.

Merlin: Yeah. And there may not be anything in there because they aren't flipped on. It's *really* weird. It's like that dot INI thing, with PHP--it's like, "Why is this not already on?" 

Merlin: Anyway. You go in and you can build- there's services in there that are *so* useful, where you can do things, like with Scrivener I can like have a selection of text somewhere, hit a button and that gets created as a new document inside of Scrivener. Which is really helpful. I've written one (laughs) the worst Bash script of all times is for concatenating--or not concatenating, it's for, what is it? You know, whatever the greater than greater than, but like *appending* to a text file?

Dan: Yeah, yeah. Appending.

Merlin: Yeah. And so I'll have run that as a script inside of Launchbar, and it's terrifically helpful. But what's neat about this service, which I can recommend--hey! let's make this like a pick-- this service (typing), which is something Gruber--I learned about from Gruber--it's [waffle software dot net](http://wafflesoftware.net). You know in the Unix you got standard in and standard out and filter, right?

Dan: Yep.

Merlin: Which is just a way of saying, like, is this something where it's coming in? Or where it's going out? Or where it's just passing through and I'm spitting something out? Is that fair? Is that close?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: And this service makes it really easy to take basically any script that your Mac can run--whether it's Perl or Python, or whatever--and you *package* it inside of a service. So it goes from being this thing where you go like, "Oh. I gotta remember to go to this place, I 'cd' in there and then I run this dot py to do whatever." Instead, in my case, [HTML to text dot py](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/), you know, the Aaron Schwartz's Markdown thing?

Dan: *Right*.

Merlin: I've got that under this service now. I used to use- Oh! Brady's bits. Long before he founded Twitter, you know Jack, back in the day, he's the guy who invented [HumaneText](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11430/humanetext.service), *long* before Twitter. He's the guy who wrote the first service for Markdown, or Textile to HTML and back--first guy.

Dan: Ah. So you could select some text, and then you can go to the service and it will, essentially, take whatever text you've selected and pipe it through the script that you've written?

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: And it does it all as part of the Finder so that you're not having to rip open the Terminal and change folders and run things and make sure the path does the thing, and [pbcopy](http://ss64.com/osx/pbcopy.html) to get it- you know about pbcopy, right?

Merlin: Ugh. pbcopy, pbcopy I keep screwing something up with pbcopy. I keep getting, like, a paste of--oh, sorry, say what pbcopy is.

Dan: pbcopy is a paste board copier--in other words it lets you take something like the output of a command, or the output of a file and direct it into the clipboard, on your Mac. The pasteboard, if you will.

Merlin: But, it--the pasteboard. But there's--can you have? You can have more than one? Because. Do you ever get a thing, where like in a session, you've got one clipboard, but back in the finder you've got another? Am I having an aphasia? Or can you have multiple pasteboards? Is that possible?

Dan: You can, but-

Merlin: Apart from multiple clipboards. I know what *that* means, like, in--but I'm saying like, what is in, when you hit Command-V, you get one thing in the Terminal, versus you get another thing in, like, the Finder.

Dan: I think Launchbar allows--if you're using, I heard you mention that you had Launchbar--I think Launchbar can do multiple clipboards, or pasteboards. Not that?

Merlin: No, no, that's what I'm saying, it's *not* that. No.

Dan: It's not that. 

Merlin: It's probably just me.

Dan: Then I don't know. Maybe it's a feature that I don't know about that I need to, you know-

Merlin: I tell you what's great, for the what do you call? P-board? What's it called? PB? PB Paste? That is *super* helpful inside of TextMate, if you're ever building TextMate bundles, it's just *huge*. But. Oh, 'cause anyway, this service, all you gotta do--if you've found a great script and you're not a total nerd and you don't want to have to go to the Finder--It's a nice ramp in, 'cause it's just super fast. And just in general, I would say look at the services, because, well among other things, I mean like everybody from David Allen to, you know, anybody who's used Unix will say, the more that you're using the keyboard rather than the mouse the faster you're going to get. How is this germane to our stuff? It's removing friction. Don't you think?

Dan: Yeah. Definitely.

Merlin: It's getting you focused. I mean it's the reason that I'm looking at Vim right now. The whole purpose of Vim--I mean, Vim and Emacs are like such different ways of seeing the world--and in Vim, as I understand VI--shout out to Arnold Robbins, who has no idea who I am--you want to keep your hands on the home row. Almost everything happens on the home row, you never even want to, I do the Emacs key bindings. I'm super into, like, Command-Shift-Arrow, for like selecting left. You know about that, right? You know that.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I mean you would not believe how many people don't know that. If you're editing text... Like right now, nerds, if you're listening to this go and open a text file (typing) and go type something. Just go type Lorem Ipsum. And if you go hit, like the clover leaf--Command--right arrow, you go to the end of the line. That's kinda cool. Now, option shift--I have to look at the keys: It's all muscles--option-shift-left arrow, do that. "*What*? That's crazy. Look at that!" Did that change your game? When you learned that?

Dan: Yeah. Like, things like that are, I think, if you're somebody who spends a lot of time on a keyboard, which generally I think it's safe to say are most Mac users are *not*, then you find out about these things. You're like, "Man! There's so much that this could do." The *Unix* geeks, like me, you start out by saying, "What can I do with the keyboard." You know? 

Merlin: Right. Are you more VI or Emacs.

Dan: VI. Please.

Merlin: OK. So--

Dan: Emacs is--

Merlin: So, H, J, K, L for you? HJKL?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Alright. Thing is though. I know, I hear where you're coming from but the thing is this is where it gets interesting for me. Because to you this is like, "Oh. So I can soak my dishes to make them easier to clean?" But for me, this is like, when I learned that, circa 2004, it was like, "Holy crap!" My text editing got so--well here's one, can I just tell you one?

Dan: Well, no. Don't. Don't. I think I'm in the *minority* here. And I think talking about this stuff is great because even though I have this base of knowledge there's still little things that I don't know. 

Merlin: Right.

Dan: And this is something I find about the way that you work, that I don't always necessarily do, is that when you discover something like that it seems to me that you're not content just knowing that one, you want to know every single keyboard shortcut that exists.

Merlin: Well. I've *been* like--Well, here's the problem.

Dan: And I don't do that.

Merlin: This is--well--you're smart. But this is also why Unix, like Photoshop, and sexual intercourse, is so overwhelming to people.

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: Because Unix, the problem is, you open up Photoshop, I've said this a thousand times, but you open up Photoshop, eventually--like go get some coffee and stuff--Um, and by the way, you're going to need to update, and don't get me started. But when it does finally launch, and you get a canvas, it *looks like* Crystalize is as important as Unsharp Mask. Right?

Dan: Mmm. Yeah.

Merlin: Don't you think? Well I haven't listened to Tech Sharp. Are you Aperture, Lightroom? What's your thing?

Dan: You know, I like Lightroom.

Merlin: Me too. I couldn't use anything else. But, um, whatever you use. I love Acorn. To be honest I use Acorn--Acorn and OmniGraffle--I use for almost everything involving drawing, which is weird because I should be using? Illustrator? Right?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: Um. The problem with Photoshop is, you open it up, and because of the way they--with respect--I have pals that work on this stuff. It's really been written in the silos that the developers think about it in. Right? There's one part of the group that works on plugins. There's another part that works on filters. Those are really different mathematical skills to make that stuff. Right? You're on different teams. So your team lives under *this* menu. Right? Kinda? You know. It's like, it isn't like you go, "Okay. Well here's the five commands, that even if you don't know you need them yet, you're just going to be using *all the time*." Like, Adjust Levels. I used to think Adjust Levels? What does that even mean? And now it's like, "Oh my gosh. I can't believe how many years I didn't know how much that could change my photos." Do you know what I mean?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: So, Unix. Same thing. I bought, and continue to read--again give it up for Arnold--[Unix in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/Unix-Nutshell-Desktop-Reference-Solaris/dp/1565924274/5by5-20) has been my bathroom book for three years. I continue to try and learn a little bit, probably let's say once, usually in the morning. And I sit down and the thing is, `troff` is not as important as `cd`. Right?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I mean. What's more important than `cd`?

Dan: `cd` is probably up there in the top one, or two. `ls`.

Merlin: `cd`, `ls`, `ls -la` for me.

Dan: Yep.

Merlin: Ah. So what does that mean? Well, `cd` is change directories. `ls` is list. `troff`? You're good. Don't worry. You don't need `troff` for a while, you're going to be fine. *But* if you pick up almost any book on Unix--especially one that's kind of 'indexy' like that--you're going to go, "Oh my God! This is *totally* inscrutable." Right? And I think that's what we're talking about right here. What we're talking about is, "Look. You don't need to learn *all* the commands. Pick up what you can. Iteration does work." Yes, lists of tips and tricks *do* work but then you've gotta go work with them. Ready for this? Do this. Do this. Hey, you nerds, open up your text file, add a bunch of returns, you don't need to put text in. Put in a bunch of returns and hit Command-Up Arrow. (key press) "What? What just happened? It's *magic*." Now hit Command-Down Arrow. "*What?* That's insane!"

Dan: (laughs)

Merlin: *Now* try Option-Up Arrow. Go to the top of the buffer.

Dan: Which shell?

Merlin: Ah, basically, I'm in TextMate, but it works anywhere. Anywhere where it's got a Cocoa-NS-Something-Something field. Right?

Dan: See I usually do this stuff on the command line and there are going to be different things that you can do.

Merlin: But all I'm saying is--why am I telling you this?--because anywhere that is a standard Mac friendly field, *all* of these will work.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I think they're based on Emacs, but they're not like the crazy, my hands hurt, kind of Emacs.

Dan: Right.

Merlin: All I'm saying is, like, Command-Up. What did I just do? I just took the cursor to the top of the buffer. I've just gone to the first character of the first line. If I hit Command-Down Arrow I've gone to the last cursor of the last line. This is *so ace*. Option-Up Arrow takes me to the next line that has stuff on it.

Dan: Yeah. These are all really great things but at the end of the day, these things are the kinds of things that you need to learn by, like, when... Like if you sit down and *try* to remember these? You won't get them. But it's when you're using them, I almost feel like you need to *watch* somebody doing this.

Merlin: I totally agree. 

Dan: You know what I mean?

Merlin: I totally agree. And I don't mean to derail this little tips and tricks crap, except to say that seriously at least for me, all I can say is what I know, and when I learned this it was like somebody took the boxing gloves off my hands. Because I type all day long, all I do is type and type and type.

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: And the ability to go, let me just remember this, and also *seriously*, TextExpander, learn about it. Erm. I created a long thing... This is. Okay. So. Command-Shift-Right Arrow select the entire line. I mean. Anyway. I know. All you guys are sitting there going, (as Van Hœt) "So. I've been doing this since 1972." But, every day. Did I mention before I lived in Florida I lived in Cincinnati, Ohio. And when the million dollar movie ran kinda short they would have a canned segment, which was like questions to the, you know, general manager of the station. And there's this line, that I will never ever ever forget, where the lady says to him, reading a letter like (whiny voice) "I don't understand. Why do you keep showing The Flintstones? The Flintstones is"--at that point--"a five year old show. Who watches The Flintstones? Everybody's seen The Flintstones. I keep seeing the same episodes. I get it, the ribs made the car fall over, move on." And the guy goes, "You know, every day somebody is born who has *never* seen The Flintstones." And I thought about that and I went, Oh my God! It is so self involved to sit there and go, (as Van Hœt) "Fail. Seen it." Because, you know what? A lot of people haven't seen it, jerk. And, like, the fact that like you know that. Well first of all, do you really, really know it? Do you really *know* it, like in the way you know that you should rotate your tires? Or are you actually like *using* it. Because in *my* experience these are the incremental things that make a difference. And, you know, can I just say? One other shout out, Dan. Because--and I want your opinion on the Vim stuff, because I really want to give that a throw but. Where did I read about this? 

Merlin:  Oh. We've gotta do an episode on my new favorite blogs. (typing) Brett Ter-Brett--isn't it weird when you don't know how to really *say* things because you only ever read it? Brett T*erp*stra?

Dan: Yeah.

Merlin: I read him a hundred times a day, but I don't know how to say his name. Not only made, my second favorite [TextMate bundle](http://bundle.weblogzinc.com/docs/index.php) of all time: The Blog Smith, insane, MultiMarkdown, lifesaving, um bundle, I'm don't think it's called that, it might be shorter. But Brett also just did that awesome fork of Notational Velocity, called [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/). Go to Brett Terpstra--Google it--[b r e t t t e r p s t r a](http://brettterpstra.com).

Dan: And we'll put these in the [show notes](http://5by5.tv/b2w/1), too.

Merlin: Oh, you'll do that? You got a monkey for that? Who does that? Is that you?

Dan: I'm the monkey.

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: Yeah. Usually. It depends. I try to keep up with it during the show but I've got a little bookmarklet that I can give you that'll let you add 'em to the CMS as we're here.

Merlin: CMS. Expression Engine?

Dan: No. It's a custom Rails thing.

Merlin: Course. (smug voice) "By the way I did [Playgrounder](http://playgrounder.com). I don't know if you know."

Dan: (laughs) I *sold* that. I sold it.

Merlin: No way. I loved that site.

Dan: That *was* Expression Engine.

Merlin: Aw, man! You handled the taxonomy on that really well. That's a *hard* problem to solve.

Dan: That was tough. And the most under appreciated site on the Internet.

Merlin: It was a terrific site. I've bought stuff for my kids through there. Well, the kids I know about. That being the one. Err. Brett's site is *terrific*! Brett is a super smart guy. I highly recommend [Brett Terpstra dot com](http://brettterpstra.com). Why am I telling you this? I *believe* it was Brett who frequently will do links to stuff about VI. I think it was he, who pointed to, something really cool called (typing) two-faced-Roman-thing. [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). And Janus is where these two nerds, who's names escape me, have basically put together an easy ramp up for anybody who wants to learn VI. Especially people who are thinking about, you know, I love TextMate, but it's been a while. And looking at basically replicating a lot of the functionality that we've come to *love*--no disrespect to Allan, I love--but Janus basically gives me something really easy, it's a package that gives you a version of [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim), plus some very cool plugins, like this tree plugin that emulates the project view. Almost all of the audience could be forgiven for thinking they're having a stroke, and that I'm saying words that don't make sense. But for those of you who use TextMate and have gone, "Mmm", have a look at this, really anybody who's thought about doing VI. Now why care about VI? Because if you've ever watched--whether it's VI or Emacs, which if you don't know are the two--wouldn't you say the two predominant text editors for Unix?

Dan: Yeah. On the command line.

Merlin: On the command line. Watching Ken Case do Emacs. Watching Danny O'Brian do VI. Do you guys remember the first time you saw [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com) and you went, "Oh. That'll change my life." (laughs)

Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

Merlin: Ah, 43 Folders became a thing, in part because of the David Allen stuff, but really the Quicksilver, without too much in modesty, I really think it helped a lot of people to learn about Quicksilver. That's a lot like this. And Vi. Give me an example of VI where you do the multiples. Like you do a yank thing and then a multiple paste. Like, what's an example of that.

Dan: Well, I mean, lets say you're doing a config file in an Apache thing, and you want to grab the entire virtual config file and drop it somewhere else.

Merlin: Or the thing I just learned, in TextMate, there must be a way to do this in Vim, I *just* learned this after years: Select anything, in TextMate. Double click whatever. Hit Command-E. Replace that with something else: Select it and type Command-E. And then Control-Command-F replaces each instance of that in the document. So it sends whatever you first selected is--it's the equivalent of, it's Find and Replace--but with like a couple, three, clicks. Did you get something like that?  Like select this thing here, you hit Command-I or whatever, this word replace--is that an 'S' thing? Is that like an S--

Dan: Yeah, this gets into the more advanced stuff, but you can--

Merlin: Yeah, you're right. Different show. Different show.

Dan: You can get into, like, Regular Expressions in Vim and there's tons and tons and tons of stuff. And most of it I didn't know, actually, and I learned when I did the voice over for a PeepCode on Vim, so yeah, there's a lot. There's so much you can do.

Merlin: Alright, I won't get too far into this.

Dan: But, now we're thirty minutes over! We told people we were gonna keep it under an hour, and our first show we're thirty minutes over.

Merlin: Yeah. It's called managing expectations. And I hopefully will not help you ruin that. Anyway go check that out. Check him out. I got a bunch of sites I'd love to talk about, Dan, that have really--I think--helped make the Mac improvement and like hacks space, *way* less douchey than it's been in the last few years. I'm going to toss just out a few, just as a shout out: [Practically Efficient](http://www.practicallyefficient.com)--Eddie's site is just *out*standing. [Brooks Review](http://brooksreview.net)--Excellent site, Google it. David Sparks, the stuff he's doing with [Mac Sparky](http://macsparky.com) is crazy great. I'd like to do like a proper--Oh, God! Doctor Drang! You've gotta go read [lean crew dot com](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/), which is, "And now it's all this." Doctor Drang's site--Google it--is probably the site that is closest to how my brain works in terms of like, here's a great thing for TextMate, here's how to print a Hipster PDA on cards. Anyway. Without running thirty minutes over, I think this is the kind of stuff we should talk about. And Dan, I wanna know about *you*. I wanna know about the stuff that's exciting you, apart from these podcast things that you make.

Dan: Well we'll save that for the next show.

Merlin: Yeah. What's got you excited this week?

Dan: This show.

Merlin: Yeah. I love you.

Dan: *This show!*

Merlin: *I love you!* Like, what else can I say? You're selling past the close. I love you.

Dan: So that's it. So we're gonna wrap this up. *Button* this thing up. 

Merlin: Yeah.

Dan: And we'll come back in another week and we'll do it again.

Merlin: Yeah. Thanks for doing this, Dan. It's going to be exciting.

Dan: I can't wait. This is just the start.

Merlin: It's a start.
