If I slip lives are in the balance.\n\rMerlin: Hello?\n\r[00:00:09.11] Dan: Hi, Merlin. \n\nMerlin: Hi, Dan.\n\nDan: How are you?\n\nMerlin: I'm pretty good. How are you?\n\nDan: Pretty good. You want to button this up?\n\nMerlin: Mm hmm. I love you.\n\nDan: Love you too. \r\rMerlin: How many people would just love it if that was the whole show?\n\nDan: Yeah, we should release that and then do a bonus episode. \n\nMerlin (as Van HÅ“t):  So: Erm, I'm really glad you stopped talking about parenting, things.\n\nDan: We got a lot of feedback about that, didn't we?\n\nMerlin: Ah, in email?\n\nDan: Yeah. And some on Twitter also.\n\nMerlin: Well, I'll let you tell me what people said in email. What I read on Twitter is that a lot of people like it.\n\nDan: Yeah, that's what I heard. \r\rMerlin: That's because people, people with kids know how to use Twitter. People with cats use email. \r\rMerlin: That was, I think that was Craft Eving who first discovered that in like the, either the forties or the seventeen hundreds. I'll have to look it up.\n\nMerlin: No, I, you know what, I would not mind breaking that off. I don't know if that's interesting just as a topic. You know what I mean? It's one that's pretty broad. And you could get, well, I'm being a contrary because that's what I do. Like I totally understand how annoying that is. I felt the same way. \n\nMerlin: But it might get a little old. You know what I mean? What do you think? I mean, God damn, there's so much daddy foo and mommy bar out there, right?\n\nDan: There is, but you're not doing it. \n\nMerlin: It may be bad. I think I just made a blogging joke, a parenting joke, and potentially you programming joke all in the same, extremely not funny joke. \n\nDan: I think you need more shows apparently. You need a lot more shows. You're not doing enough shows. \n\nMerlin: Here's the thing. If you chase two rabbits they will both escape. You should write that down. \n\nDan: I'm gonna write that.\n\nMerlin: Chase two. \r\rDan: I'm gonna write that down.\n\nDan: I knew a kid named Chase. When I was working at Publix. \n\rMerlin: I know a guy name Chase. Chase Reeves. He's on the internet. I know a Chase. Chase is a pretty good name. \n\nDan: That's a cool name. Not as good as Cash. If we'd had a second boy. If our second kid had been a boy, I had an agreement with my wife, a standing agreement, that I could name him Cash. \n\nMerlin: After the, after the currency or the guy with the guitar?\n\nMerlin: Both.\n\nMerlin: See? That is good. That's good. There's a.\n\nDan: She said you can't, you can't, you can't name someone Cash. I said of course you can.\n\nMerlin: Dan, you can literally name your kids anything, and that's the problem.\n\nDan: Isn't that funny?\n\nMerlin: Oh my gosh.\n\nDan: Faith would like to read one of the emails that we received regarding doing a parenting show.\n\nMerlin: Is Faith gonna be like a regular on shows now, is that a thing?\n\nFaith: What?\n\nMerlin: She's like, is it..? But no, I want to understand so I can adjust my mojo. I have things on cards and I want to get a card for Faith, if I need that.\n\nDan: She's handling some of the work that assists me, and rather than have me be on that email account reading email she has it. So I said, Faith, can you pick one of these?\n\nMerlin: Questions, questions don't hurt Dan. Just fear.\n\nDan: I said, "Faith, can you pick one of these?" And she said "Sure". \n\nMerlin: Only fear hurts. \n\nDan: So she has it and she's ready to read it. \n\nMerlin: Questions are like orange cones. You can hit them all they want. Doesn't hurt the cones, doesn't hurt you. Hi Faith!\n\nFaith: Hi Merlin. How are you?\n\nMerlin: I'm great! Are you going to do it in a funny voice?\n\nFaith: No, I don't think so. Is it okay with you if I read this email though?\n\nMerlin: If you were very familiar with the Cohen brothers, you could have responded with something like unless you consider round funny. Is it from a fan? Is this pro. Is this anti? Is this.\n\nFaith: This is pro. \n\nMerlin: Okay.\n\rFaith: This is pro-parenting.\n\nMerlin: I would love to hear it.\n\nFaith: And pro you talking about parenting.\n\nMerlin: I think it's fantastic idea, I would love to hear it.\n\nFaith: Okay. This email is from Kevin McAllister. He says, "Yo Internet pals. All the people that tell you not to talk about kids, they're wrong. Parents talk about their kids for the same reason college people talk about their college and gang members talk about their last rumble. Because it's the hardest and most rewarding thing they've ever had to do in their life. \n\nFaith: Poor, sad gang members".\n\nDan: That's good! \n\nMerlin: It is good, and...\n\nDan: That's marked in the pro-column. \n\nMerlin: Is it Mr. McAllister? Is that correct? Kevin?\n\rFaith: Yes. \n\nDan: I call him Chevy. \r\rMerlin: That's a pretty cool name. I would have been so happy to be a Kevin. Kevin, Jason, Todd. I would have loved a name like that when I was a kid. Dan. Are you kidding me? Dan. I would have killed to be a Dan, a Danny, a Daniel, a Danster. I would have killed for any of that. Literally, Dan.\n\nFaith: Isn't Kevin McAllister the kid from Home Alone? This is kind of ironic.\n\nDan: Is that his name?\n\nFaith: Yeah, I think is.\n\nDan: You mean Cauly Mc-?\n\nFaith: Well Macaulay Culkin is the actor, but Kevin McAllister is the...\n\rDan: Macaulay?\r\rFaith:  Yeah.\rMerlin: I think you're thinking of the Wonder Years. \n\nFaith: I don't think so. \n\nDan: Oh, I think you're thinking of that Christmas movie where he dresses up like a bunny. \r\rMerlin: Oh, Breaking Bad?\n\nDan: I haven't seen that.\n\nMerlin: Was it Harvey or Donny Darco? Which is the one that was too long? \n\nDan: Oh, you're thinking of The Cleaner from Pulp Fiction, Harvey Keitel.\n\nMerlin: Okay, and he also appears in that movie with Bridget Fonda, where they remade the French movie where she jumps down the pipe. What's that called? \n\nDan: Ah.\n\nMerlin: Point of No Return. \n\rDan: On Golden Pond. \r\rMerlin: Jumping down. That's funny. She loves scarves. \r\rMerlin: I think...\n\nDan: No...\n\nMerlin: It was a wonderful note. It was a good reading and my only concern is I think you could talk a lot about gangs. I could talk about my background and my gang The North Side. We had pink satin jackets.\n\nDan: Wow, okay.\n\nMerlin: Well. No, no, not in that sense, not that kind of pink. It said, it said "For the love of God, please stop pumelling me".\n\nDan: Not that kind of pink. \n\nMerlin: For the love of God, please stop pumelling me. \n\nMerlin: And we basically were everybody's starter gang. You start with us. We had nothing to protect and we didn't protect it. And you could just hit us all day until you are tired. I think you could talk about gangs and people who are not in gangs would enjoy that. I think the parenting thing is super interesting to most people who are parents and excruciating many people who are not. \n\nDan: But the best thing about breaking it off is if you are not a parent you just don't listen. \n\nMerlin: You'd think. \n\nDan: You know, you just don't listen. \r\rMerlin: It's true. It's true. I don't know. What do you think Faith? Would you, do you enjoy a podcast about parenting?\n\nFaith: I enjoy when you guys talk about it, yeah. And I'm not a parent. \n\nMerlin: We could do a recipe for Snickerdoodles. We could talk about schools. We could talk about circumcision and breastfeeding.\n\nDan: Home schooling?\n\nMerlin: Oh god, home schooling, breastfeeding and circumcision. That's your name. You just need art. Talk to your buddy about getting some art. \n\nDan: Okay. I'll work on that. \r\rMerlin: Ahh, we could have a Dad-vertorial. A Mom... Mom-verse-I got nothin'. \r\rMerlin: I don't know. You know what? I'm going to leave it to Faith. I think Faith is a voice of sanity amidst all of whatever this is, and, I think you could do it. You know, I got to tell you Dan, I think this, you're leaving a lot of money on the table and by money I don't mean money. \n\nMerlin: But I think you should do more cross show dealies. \n\nDan: I'm doing it. \n\nDan: There's been a whole plan-\n\nMerlin: As you know, as you know-\n\nDan: You guys sort of bust it up when I was out, it kind of ruined. \n\nMerlin: Okay. \n\nDan: Stole some thunder.\n\nMerlin: Orange cones, Dan. \n\nDan: I have Dharmadad.com which I could donate to the... \n\nMerlin: Could we get a podcast about how opaque you are? Maybe there already is one. Okay, see here's the thing. \r\rDan: It's the show. \r\rMerlin: It's late and I don't have access to it. I would do whatever you want 'cuz you know, for me.\n\nDan: I have a list of things I'd like for you to do.\n\nMerlin: Really? Are any of them sexy?\n\nDan: Anything you do is gonna be.\n\nMerlin: That's sweet of you to say. \n\nMerlin: I think I would be happy to do any of that. And you know what you get, you know what we call it, in the world of the enterprise class products? In physics we call it synergy. It's synergy. Sometimes, one times one equals, I guess, more than one. Right? \r\rMerlin: You take a Syracusa times an Arment, right? That's synergism. That's just spoons and spoons of synergism. You're going to cover the waterfront with that on a good way. \n\nDan: Some people refuse to do crossover shows. \r\rMerlin: Oh, for religious reasons? \n\nDan: I don't know why.\n\nMerlin: Oh, you know what, I bet GPL. \r\rDan: Hmm.\r\rMerlin: They call it the third rail. \n\nDan: BSD?\n\nMerlin: Yeah, I use the free GPL. I'm running that on the Berkeley. \r\rMerlin: I made cards for today's shows. I didn't tell you that. I made cards. \n\nDan: Is this on your hipster pad? The thing that you have? \n\nMerlin: I swore I would never prepare. \r\rMerlin: You know what? Can we round back to that? Because I want to talk about this. Maybe in the After Dark we should talk about this, because I think that would be. \r\rMerlin: You know, seriously, the Marco and Syracuse idea is very interesting to me, because, it isn't just because they have complementary interests but contrasting takes. \n\nMerlin: They're both genuinely super smart about slightly different things, and I think that that would be a very interesting thing and they're smart about a lot of the same stuff too. But, you can get that anywhere, right? You get a cute girl and kind of heavy Korean guy, that's a sixty podcast. You are literally going to tear up the charts.\n\nDan: Wow. These are the secrets I'd like to-\n\nMerlin: Can I be honest with you? The heavy Korean guys can be a little harder to find. Right? So. \r\rMerlin: I guess we should do a little bit of follow up. \n\nMerlin: I got cards, I got cards.\n\nDan: What does that mean? \n\rMerlin: (sound of cards being drummed in a stocato rythmn)\r\rMerlin: They're not like nice cards. Well I prepared. I promised I wouldn't prepare but I-\r\rDan: Like a four by six?\n\rMerlin:  I'm trying to make the show- I don't want to say better - but I want to keep the show good; so I'm to think. So:\r\rDan:  Four by six?\n\rMerlin: No. No, I do three by five. I like four by six. \n\nDan: Ruled or unruled? \n\nMerlin: Umm. Ruled. \n\nDan: College-ruled or standard? \n\nMerlin: Wide-rule? Like goofy ruled?\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: No. Whatever the pink line at the top and the blue lines. The classic. The classic. This is the thing about Hipster PDA. \n\nMerlin: You know, and this is what's funny about it, the whole idea was you could have this fairly robust system for running things, out of stuff you could buy for a buck at a drugstore. And that's why it's funny when Levenger wanted to put out custom 'Hipster PDA Cards', which I think they did. That's pretty funny. \r\rDan: Did you benefit from that financially? \n\nMerlin: I benefited heavily by saying are you out of your (cut) mind, (cut). I think that was an exact quote. It was 2005, it was a long time ago. \r\rMerlin: (Humming and tapping in time) Boy that Logic's fun to play with. I did a whole thing in logic. It's pretty cool. \n\nDan: Oh, for your other show, your other new show? \n\nMerlin: I don't understand what you mean. Here's the thing. F.U. Okay, never mind. Never mind. I'm not going to talk about Star Wars. It's killing me not to talk about Star Wars. \n\nDan: You know what I finally got a hold of? Is the Star Wars Revisited, I fin-, I've got it right here. \n\nMerlin: You looked at it? \n\nDan: I was gonna start it, and then I got a little behind on time. Still haven't watched it yet. \n\nMerlin: The new one looks really good. You can see Carrie Fisher's freckles, I did not know she had freckles. You can also see that she literally looks like a clown. I don't know, I think somebody was doing the make up from back in Marin County, firing it out of a cannon, and asking her to stand somewhere near where they thought it would land. \n\nDan: Sort of like the bot that went haywire in Wall-E.\n\nMerlin: Precisely. \n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: After they knocked down, after they shot off the thing, and all the things went down. \n\nDan: Absolutely. \r\rMerlin: God that movie's good.\n\nMerlin: Yeah, gorgeous.\n\nMerlin: God that movie's good. \r\rMerlin: Anyway, After Dark. It's a travesty. I've never heard John so upset about something except being out of liquor. I've never heard him so upset. He was beside himself. Twenty minutes he sounded, he just kept saying it over and over, \r\rDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: (softly) "No, no, no". \r\rMerlin: Okay. We've been talking. Should we start the show? \n\nDan: You want to? \n\nMerlin: Yup. Good week? \n\nDan: No, big week. Big week. \r\rMerlin: Huge week. Huge, huge, huge week. \r\rDan: What've you been up to?\r\rMerlin: Oh, you kidding me? I got- (sound of cards being wafted in front of the microphone)\n\nDan: Well, let's hear them. Stop teasing you know, and dancing around it. Let's hear the cards. \n\nMerlin: Should I just start it Dan? Orange cones. Orange cones, they don't hurt anybody. \r\rMerlin: You have said this before, and I think this is a great idea. You've mentioned this at least twice before, is in the context of saying to me, "Merlin, have we ever done a show about how to say no?" \r\rMerlin: And then one time we made a joke, and the other time we said no but you mentioned it once before. \n\nMerlin: I think it is a good topic for a show, and I think it is another link in our chain of what ideas. Because we've talked about the priority stuff before. What'd we talk about last week? We talked about parenting and Star Wars. Apart from that, what did we talk about? The, what was the topic of the show last week?\n\nMerlin: Last week, you probably lost track of it beause these other shows that you do. \n\nMerlin: I literally have no idea what you mean. And your name is Dan, is that correct?\n\nMerlin: Last week we talked about unreasonable demands.\n\nMerlin: Unreasonable demands, conflicting demands. Those ugly demand twins. They always dress 'em the same. \n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: That's weird. Would you do that? Would you dress your twins the same? \r\rDan: I don't know. I've thought about that before. And I guess the upside to dressing them the same is that nobody would doubt that they were related. \r\rMerlin: Right. \r\rDan: Even though they look identical. Wait, do you mean identical twins or fraternal twins? \n\rMerlin: Well-\rDan: Because if they were fraternal, then I would say yes, dress them identically. But if they're identical I would say no, do not. Dress them fraternally. \n\nMerlin: Dress them fraternally? \r\rDan: Yeah.\r\rMerlin: I would dress them- I take your point. I think what you're saying is, it's like, it's like being as fat your partner; like you can share shirts and couches, right? The idea is you get the same shoe size, you got economies of scale. I think that's what you're saying, and it's cute for a while. For a while. I would dress them - let me say this, it's a little more work - I think you dress them exactly the same but one of them looks a little shoddier. \n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: I think there's one who's consistently not getting the same level of like laundry, or personal hygiene. So Timmy and Tommy are wearing the same clothes, but Tommy's clothes are just not as good. It's still identical, but that way I can tell them apart and I think the people who will judge them, it'll become easy for them to be able to know which is which. Then, then to know Tommy's better or is it Timmy. \r\rMerlin: It's hard to say no.\n\rDan: Did you, did you have a twin?\n\nMerlin: Not that I'm aware of. I barely have me.\n\nDan: That's good. \r\rMerlin: Yeah, that twin thing's creepy. And not just like, setting aside the Kubrick.\n\nMerlin: Did you read that whole thing?\n\nMerlin: I asked Grubes about it. Did you ever read? You know what, never mind.\n\nDan: The Shining?\n\nMerlin: Did you ever read the whole analysis?\n\nDan: I did because of you and I thought we need to talk about that at some point but that guy has his head screwed on wrong. \r\rMerlin: Gruber said in the cereal episode, that you didn't hear, that I thought was really smart. He says they did the upside down pyramid. Where you go, "Oh, this seems really sensible". The first five pages of this are extremely cogent and obviously very carefully put together. \n\nMerlin: This is a different show. But you know you get into the Goofy, dressin' like Goofy? That was pretty weird. \n\nDan: It was weird dressing like Goofy.\n\nMerlin: It was weird. I mean the guy seems really, yeah.\n\nDan: It seems like you look at that and you're like well, he has a point but, do you think that was intentional? Like, is Kubrick the kind of guy, who every single thing, and every single frame, and every single shot means something? Or is he focusing on the bigger picture so to speak? \n\nMerlin: Right. Well, there's that phrase that I've never really understood but seems like it almost, when people say, "Well it's the exception that proves the rule". I still have no idea what that phrase means, but I'm gonna assume that it means something like: \r\rMerlin: Yeah, you know what, he sweats a lot of stuff. Right? He's thought through a lot of this. And anybody if you've seen the documentaries about him. Or anybody who's ever cried through the shooting of one of his films. Will tell you that, talk about opaque. I mean, my gosh, you're practically translucent next to that guy. \n\rDan: (chuckles quietly)\rMerlin: You know, like he will just tell you he will not give you a note. Right, you're just gonna do this sixty times and it might be the first take that he uses. Right? He's not gonna tell you. But the exception proves the rule part: Because he is so, it's so well documented, that he is so careful about everything, I think it's not a far leap, if you're trying to make a point about something, to then apply that to everything. \r\rMerlin: And I think the answer is 'no'. I don't think it was intentional. And I think that if there were something, he was gonna sweat like that. It would not be how a, well, like a sticker on a door means that, what's her name?\n\nDan: Shelley Duvall.\n\nMerlin: Shelley Duvall that she, therefore with her buck teeth and her churling cry laugh. She is literally a Disney character. See? It's kind of like going out. You know what? I could do this too. You ready for this? Hey, do you have a door? You have French doors in there, right? \n\nDan: Yeah, we do.\n\nMerlin: Can I ask you a question?\n\nDan: Go ahead.\n\nMerlin: Are those doors rectangular?\n\nDan: Yes.\n\nMerlin: Did you ever notice that all the doors in your house are rectangular?\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: Ok. See? Let me ask you this. You listening?\n\nDan: We're putting some big mysteries together here.\n\nMerlin: Okay. Let's put a little bit of meat on the bone. OK? \n\nMerlin: Would you say that your refrigerator inside is more warm or cold.\n\nDan: It's a little more cold inside. \n\nMerlin: Pretty much the same as almost every, except ones that aren't plugged in, pretty much the same with all of them, right?\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: Does it have a door on it?\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: Thank you. See. And that's why Jack is molesting Danny.\n\nDan: For those who aren't following this. Merlin and I are talking about-\r\rMerlin: Ears.\r\rDan: -a write up-\r\rMerlin: Doors.\r\rDan: -that somebody did that had this some sort of underlying theory about The Shining and Stanley Kubrick.\n\nMerlin: He called it, I believe he called it, 'The Subliminal' (pauses and groans disapprovingly). 'The subliminal message'. The story about the real story. The subliminal message of The Shining.\n\nDan: Hidden, hidden meanings in The Shining. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. What you may or may not have seen hidden in The Shining. Is that it?\n\nMerlin: It's called like, "doors, windows and mazes", or something? \n\nDan: Something.\n\nMerlin: It's got a blue background? \n\nDan: Yeah, yeah, I can dig that out.\n\nMerlin: We should, you know, this should be a show. This should be a whole show, in movie show. So parenthood. (laughs) Psych! \r\rMerlin: We've done all these shows and you said, asked this really good question, which is how to say, "no". And I think it's a great question because I think the implicit problem in a lot of the "that's fine for Merlin-ish things", which I think, obviously, I think we have proven that it's fine for lots of people, in a way that's really annoying; It's not just me. \r\rMerlin: But I think where the rubber meets the road, is you say "well, okay that's all well and good, but I do have a really hard time saying 'no' to things". \r\rMerlin: And I think most of the time when people say that, the big part of the pie would be because I feel like I don't have an option except to say "yes", unqualified "yes". \n\nMerlin: But there's also things I'd like to do, and so I find myself saying yes to things because I want to do lots of stuff. But then I think what happens is most of us then feel overwhelmed because we've got too much, and then we have to start screaming, "no", in order to, like, maintain a sense of sanity.\n\nDan: Feeling overwhelmed.\n\nMerlin: Mmhmm. \r\rDan: I think that's a pretty typical feeling.\n\nMerlin: I said this last week. I think when you bring up a topic, it's a bee in your bonnet. What?- \r\rMerlin: Can you give me an example of - And this is really, like I say - last week's unreasonable demands came out of this I think. \n\nDan: Yeah. \n\nMerlin: And so what are the sorts of things that you, if I may ask, as your best friend, what are the kinds of things that you find yourself having trouble saying no to? Or to whom? If that's the important part. \n\nDan: I don't think I have a problem saying no.\n\nMerlin: I don't think you do. I'm guessing you're thinking of what we were talking about last week. Like when you're starting out in some gig, and you don't have a lot of work, or you know, you're trying to build a client base, or let's say you're new at a job. You know, like I said, my job with Dave, I didn't have a lot of control over what I did. \n\nMerlin: I was really happy to have the job. \n\nDan: You like to please, too. \n\nMerlin: (Umm) Thank you. I really. God, that's so nice of you. I do. I do. I think I do. \n\nDan: No, I'm being serious when I say that. \r\rMerlin: I think 'one' likes to please, also. I think it's just a natural thing. I think anybody who works in an office as awful as it can be some days I think you would rather say yes than no, to anybody. Not just your boss, but anybody. You want to, you know. In a lot of companies, that is the way you make your bones is by showing that you can, you know, ship stuff, and that you're not sounding like Johnny Pushback, right? \n\nMerlin: So that's maybe what you're talking about. That's, that's where a lot of us get that. \n\nDan: (Sniggering) Johnny Pushback.\n\nMerlin: You ever see that? I think it's was with Michael Keaton. \n\nDan: It's a good one. \n\nMerlin: Yeah. But it is hard, and so anyway, that's a good topic, and yeah, I agree. I agree with myself. It's a good topic. But I think behind that though, is this notion that either I can't say no to things don't want to say no to things. And I think for the people who are more potentially interested in this prattling on, it probably is an instance of I feel like I can't say no. \n\nMerlin: Right? And so, what does that mean? Well that means if you can't say no, then a lot of the stuff we talk about on here is going to be for naught. It is just going to be kinda Blue-sky Solutioneering if it doesn't have a practical c_o_mponent, or comp_o_nent as you say, of what I do. Your priority stuff. Okay. That's great, care and sacrifice, fantastic, wonderful slide. \n\nMerlin: But what does that mean if I have to say yes to everything? Or, for example, like I said this company that I've referenced in the past, you know, and this is true in lot's of places. This constant fear that someone's going to dive bomb in and screw all this up. I can work really hard on this thing, and then somebody could jump in and totally change this?\n\nMerlin: Right? There's always that feeling that I'm always one long, stupid meeting away from my job being turned upside down. You know what I mean? I don't know if that makes sense, but I think you start to get this sense of self doubt, if you feel like, it's almost this kind of occupational constipation, where you feel like you're never like finishing anything, the goal is always changing, but above it all, there is somebody always running around, not really thinking stuff through and just demanding you do things. \n\nMerlin: I don't know if that's true. But it feels that way and a lot of companies to me. I don't know. So I don't know if that's a problem statement but I think that's the way to think of that. Either you can't say no or you don't want to say no. Are there other flavors of that? \n\nDan: No, I think being able to say no in a way that communicates everything that you just described. Because you have to. There are so many people that don't want to say no, and it's a career killer. Because they're shut down.\n\nMerlin: Well, yeah, and I don't want to make a straw man out of this, but I think a lot of times, at least when I chat with people about this, It's another one of those solutions. Like sorry to be all like frikkin', you know, Kung Fu. But like it's not easy, but it is simple. The non easy part is that, if you want to protect your good thing, you can't just say yes to everything. \n\nMerlin: Otherwise, how could you do a good job stuff if you don't have any kind of filter for that? But then, the relatively simple part is, well, that is the case; the simple part is that your wallet does not make money and you can't put more blocks in the box. And as much as those two tell a story, I think there are a lot of people who are trying to, there's a cognitive dissonance in trying to say "Well of course I can do this stuff well, and of course I can say yes to everything." And then they're stressed out and now they're mad at me, or whomever.\n\rMerlin: (laughs)\n\nDan: Cognitive dissonance.\n\nMerlin: Cognitive dissonance, you know? I don't know the precise, I couldn't give you the clinical definition but I think what it means is that when well, it's when, I think one of the ways is that there's a difference between reality and what you think reality should be. Or that, you know, it's something about the whole.\n\nDan: I like that.\n\nMerlin: Yeah, isn't it like an old Keats line about, you know, that ability to hold two conflicting views in your head? And so I think in the abstract, cognitive dissonance is a very interesting idea like a-\n\nDan: That's the core of, not to get into the whole Buddhism thing again, but that's the core of suffering is that things are different from the way that you believe that they should be. \n\nMerlin: Right. Totally, but it's also another instance of the Western World wanting everything to be a zero or one and being confounded when someone says well, "it's zero and it's one and it's everything else". \r\rDan: Right. \n\nMerlin: Like, sorry to be all liberal arts. But I mean, that can be the case a lot of the time with things, and just because you're looking for some kind a reductive system that fits your mental model. \n\nMerlin: Well if that mental model does not comport with how stuff is actually going, you are going to have cognitive dissonance, and too much cognitive dissonance, combined with the sense of inescapability is the recipe for stress. That's what stress is. I think stress is the feeling that something screwed up is going on here, 'A', and that 'B', I have no control over that and 'C' it might go on forever, right? \n\rDan: Yeah.\r\rMerlin: If you think about it, it's like stress. Anybody can handle a little stress, anybody can like stay up late doing a project they don't love. But there's something really dispiriting about the anxiety of knowing that an untenable situation could, have to be a reality, theoretically, forever. And feeling, and then as you've mentioned before, like feeling like you don't have a way out. \n\nMerlin: Right, you got a new kid, you got a mortgage, you got something. Maybe, maybe, you know, you've worked your whole life to get this position. You know? Maybe it's some kind of Hollywood thing, maybe it's some kind of Wall Street thing. You're not just going to throw that out because you know, whatever, you're getting an ulcer and your wife wants to divorce you. You're not crazy? Right? \n\nMerlin: But I mean, and I'll just take it as read. Let's read it in to the record, all of our many previous episodes about the priorities thing. Like I said in that talk I did at Pixar a couple weeks ago, the big point I wanted to make is that this whole priority-mania should come down to the notion of combining care and sacrifice, right?\n\nMerlin: If you, this is brief, but it's really hard to make anything a priority if you don't care a lot about it. And it's hard to show that it's a priority unless you're making sacrifices. And so if you care about things without sacrificing things, well, it's not really getting taken care of. But if you sacrifice too much for things you don't really care about; that's a much more nuanced and troubling thing. Because you may not even realize, "why am I so frustrated about this?". Well maybe you don't want this job. Maybe you don't- I mean, when I say, "you don't want this job", maybe this is the wrong place for you. And you're trying so hard to find something to care about that you don't realize how much you're sacrificing. \n\n[00:26:27.23] Merlin: So, to me the up-shot of that though does become that, like, whether you like it or not this immutable law of the world is that, you know, you can't do it all. And again, back to that episode, whatever, 'Failure is not an option'.\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: I think there are people who are in aerospace, or neurosurgery, or who are dicks, that are going to say, "Well, you know failure is not an option. If I slip, lives are in the balance." \r\rMerlin: It's like, OK, you know what, I'm fine with that, but I think what you really mean is either you don't know what that means, or 'B', you're putting extraordinary resources and care into what you're doing so that failure is less likely to be an option. If anybody says failure is not an option, but then doesn't fund it that way, then they're just full of crap. \n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: So that's kind of the problem. You know? And talk about cognitive dissonance, again we've talked about this before, but what could be a greater source of cognitive dissonance than seeing very clearly with your Buddhist eyes for yourself what the reality is, but being forced to hold this idea that's very different in your head? Right? \n\nMerlin: So when somebody comes in and says they have 27 priorities, I'm sitting there and my eyes are spinning like a freaking one-armed bandit, going, "what can that mean?" And then when they stop spinning for a minute, and the cherries pop up, I look around and it's like nobody else thought that was weird. \n\nMerlin: I would lose my mind in a place like that. I would lose my mind, you know, we can't always say true things for a variety of reasons as human beings but like, to be compelled into an atmosphere where it's just not appropriate to say true things, where the picture of the Sail Boat wins, is very distressing to me. \n\nMerlin: So I think we should talk about that, I think that's enough ground work. But I think it's- all I wanted to get at is that I think for this to make the most sense I think you do have to be a little bit of a grown up and understand that you can't have everything, you can't do everything and if you need to think about it in terms of money that's not a bad way to think about it. \n\nMerlin: Like I said at this Pixar talk, like, when I was there we picked up a Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear, who actually smelled like strawberries. It was really cool.\n\nDan: The actual toy? \n\nMerlin: But it was big, it was huge, it like almost as big as her. It was like thirty bucks. But you know, this is called pandering, but I was like "If I go down to the gift shop I've got thirty five bucks in my wallet like I can get a Lots-o' out the door", right? I think that includes tax. This is how they roll at Pixar. \n\nMerlin: But if I go in there and I say well, you know what, actually I really want fifty Lots-O' Huggin' bears. They're gonna go, "Ok, well that's gonna be something on the order of fifteen hundred dollars." And I'm gonna say, "No, you don't understand. I really want this, and I'm busy, so give me fifty Lots-O' Huggin' bears". \n\nMerlin: You don't understand that's bananas behavior, and yet that cashier said, "yes", to everything that everybody asked of her, you know, you've worked in the service industry you've run your own bank, probably as a waiter. Like you gotta go, now you're gonna owe that money to the restaraunt because you said yes to everything. Well why would it be any different with the things that you agree to do? \n\nMerlin: At the end of the day, you're gonna have to, somebody's going to square that and you're gonna have to be responsible for the delta. Does that make sense as a foundation? \n\nDan: Very. \r\rMerlin: Next card. \r\rDan: Is this like a stack, how, how tall is the stack?\r\nMerlin: Let me see here, let me get the rest of them. Let's see here. So, this is one ok. (sound of a stack of cards being flicked through). \r\rMerlin: Let's see, get number two. (more card flicking sounds) That's a joke. No. I've got like two more. We'll talk about whatever you want. You want to talk about parenthood? You want to talk about Star Wars?\n\nDan: No, I like this topic. \r\rMerlin: The jokey thing I'm going to say in a second is that I think there's three things you can do. You can either, when you're confronted with a situation where you're not sure what to do and you kind of, your guy is telling you to say no, or your calendar is telling to say no, or your wallet is telling you to say no for that matter. \n\nMerlin: I think there's three things you can, you can not really say no. You can really say no, or you can keep saying yes. I can't think of any other options. I only spent ten minutes on this, but I can't think of any other ones. The most intriguing for our purposes is definitely don't really say no. \n\nMerlin: You can kind of say yes. There are a lot of things where you just really need to say no. \n\nDan: What's in your life that you feel saying no is a challenge. Your kid? Since we're talking parenting. This is the parenting show. \n\nMerlin: I have lot's of, I don't know, this is one of those left handed compliments, but I have a lot of acquaintances, like, from the Internet, people I've met, we've exchanged emails, maybe I've done stuff with them, interviews, podcasts, stuff like that. \n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: This isn't directed at any one person, except that it is all of you, whom I love, is that you know, a lot of times somebody's like, "I'm coming through town tomorrow. Like, do you want to get coffee?" And I'm like, "Yes, I absolutely want to get coffee but like no way in the world, can I do it tomorrow."\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\n And not because I'm busy, like, I don't want to get tied with the whole productivity guru thing, because I'm not, and I'm not that busy, but I do have stuff I already kind of agreed to do. \n\nMerlin: Do you now what I mean? \n\nDan: Yeah. \n\nMerlin: And on top it all, of course now I've got to go to my Lady and say, "you know, how you like do everything for us? Like how about I just go take half a day to do this thing I read about yesterday?".\n\nDan: Right.\n\nMerlin: And like, she's awesome about it but like, I hate asking her that, because you know, there's this big pie. Again, back to the pies, you know, you should talk to your buddy about this. You know you got a big pie, right?\n\nMerlin: And I feel like there's this pie of like, there's just all this stuff that I could be doing better and with more time. And let's just call it home life, right? I could always be fixing more broken stuff. I could always be playing more Thomas the Train. I could always be reading more books. I try not to let that make me crazy. That notion that that is endless.\r\rMerlin: But the trouble is anything that I do that's not that pie that I consider, like, a pretty important pie. I'm taking chunks out of that pie to go do something else. So even when I'm doing good stuff, when I'm doing work, when I'm doing this, whatever it is, stuff I love, stuff I do, that is like that comes out of another pie first. \n\nMerlin: So then you've got the work pie, you know what I mean, that came out of that first pile. And now, everything I do, on some level, I am robbing Peter to pay Paul for any of that stuff. \n\nDan: Yeah.\r\nMerlin: There's somebody who's not getting that hundred percent, which is okay. Like that's life. But I think if you don't look at it that way, it's easy to lose track of things. So it's hard for me to say no when somebody I genuinely like, you know, wants to hang out, or do something. And I don't mean to sound snooty about it, but it's really hard to do that. \n\nMerlin: If I do that four times a month, then that's two days of the week for me. You know what I mean? That's like two working days if I do that, plus I'm blowing a lot of my fun equity with my Lady by, you know. Do you get that?\n\nDan: I do feel that.\n\nMerlin: Do you just go out and do stuff, like you don't drink and stuff so you probably don't go anywhere. But do you ever just want to go play D and D tonight and you just leave? You don't do that, right? \n\nDan: No.\n\nMerlin: Yeah, because like, you're, the deal is like, you're there. Like I'm bath guy or I'm dishes guy, there's all these things. If she's bath gal, my wife, then I really definitely want to be dishes guy because, you know what I'm saying? I'm sorry, parenthood, blah blah blah. But that's what I have trouble saying because I really love doing it. \n\nMerlin: I really, I love drinking. And I like hanging out with people. I like coffee, I like showing people stuff I like in the city, and I like people. Yes, it is actually true. \r\rDan: You're like, like a people person. \n\nMerlin: I don't know. My friend John says he defines an introvert as somebody who doesn't get, he defines an extrovert as someone who gets recharged by being around other people. \n\nMerlin: I thought it meant talking a lot, and being like me. But I'm starting to think I might be an introvert if that's your broken definition, and it probably is, because he's not very smart. \n\nDan: The flipside of that, in other words to say it is, do you feel drained when you're with people or when you have to be with people? Do you feel exhausted afterwards? \n\nMerlin: If it's people I like, I don't. But I, think about, like you went to WWDC, you've been to South By Southwe- No wait you've never been to South by Southwest. \n\rDan: No.\r\nMerlin: But if you go to on of those things. \n\nDan: But I have been to WWDC.\r\rMerlin: It's like Vegas, like for anybody but Gruber. You go there, and it is really fun, and it is really overwhelming, it is really cool, but I just retract back into my snail shell after like a day of that. I'm like, okay, I just I need to go watch some Dog Whisperer, and like get some ice cubes out of the machine for a little while. \n\nMerlin: I just need to be here in my daggy pants. \n\nDan: Do you get ice cubes from the machine? I always feel like they're contaminated. \n\nMerlin: Have you, I do, but have you ever gotten ice cubes from the machine? It's happened to me once, and I thought it was a fluke, but it's happened since then. Jackyls, if you have any knowledge of this, tell me. Have you ever seen little black flecks of something in hotel ice? \n\nDan: No.\n\nMerlin: I have a pair of disintegrating Sony headphones from the early two thousands with like the rubbery plastic stuff is falling off in a three centimeter flecks. \n\nMerlin: Imagine like a piece of headphones in your ice. And not like one, like six to nine. \n\nDan: The only thing I've ever used hotel ice for was to chill a beverage, I would never consume it.\n\nMerlin: What do you think? What's your concern? Contagion. \n\nDan: Contagion, contamination. \n\nMerlin: Chankers. \n\nDan: Well who knows, that's the starting point. \n\nMerlin: Well if they're inside you can't seem, it's like an ulcer. \n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: That's miserable. Wow. I love hotels. Oh, man I love hotels. \n\nDan: I never need to stay in a hotel again. \n\nMerlin: I loved hotels until I started really thinking about it. Then I started really, really really thinking about it. \n\nDan: What's your procedure when you go in there, what do you wipe down first? \n\nMerlin: This is, I shouldn't do this as a bit because I've talked about this so much.\n\nDan: Like a level five decontamination procedure or a level four? \n\nMerlin: Scott Simpson doesn't care whether I'm alive or dead except in as much as he is going to throw a roll of toilet paper where they folded it into a little diamond into my coffin as its closing. He knows how that haunts me. I now have to buy a Edgar Allan Poe style coffin, with hinges and a walkie talkie because I hate the little diamond, I hate the diamond. \n\nMerlin: Because you know what that means? If I see a little diamond on there, that means now three people have touched that toilet paper. That means, you kidding me, you could not find thirty cents to give me a fresh roll of toilet paper? And I think that says a lot about the room.\n\nDan: What about when they fold it into the fan shape?\n\nMerlin: Well, that's better. But you know what, first of all, like you're cleaning a toilet and now you touch my toilet paper. You touch my toilet paper that somebody else touched. Oh, and what about the phone, you like the phone next to there? Like I'm going to pick that thing up, the phone next to the commode, really? \n\nMerlin: I go into a room, I try not to touch too much. I remove every piece of marketing material that has branding or words on it, and I throw it all in the lowest drawer and take a photo of it, cause it's a thing that I do. Anything that involves fake plants, I put on the top shelf in the closet, and then I make a little fort. \n\nMerlin: No. This isn't interesting.\n\nDan: You don't have a sterilization routine that you do, or anything? Like a sterilization kit to decontaminate the room?\n\nMerlin: No, do you? You don't stay in hotels, you don't leave your house much.\n\nDan: No, I do.\n\nMerlin: When do you travel?\r\rDan: I've stayed in plenty of hotels.\n\nMerlin: Hmm. Name one.\n\rDan: Well I could name a handful of them.\n\nMerlin: But your not naming one, see that's the problem.\n\nDan: How about, how about the W in San Francisco? How's that?\n\nMerlin: What?\n\nDan: Where I found a blood stained pillow. How about that?\n\nMerlin: Is that by request? Is that like a special order thing?\n\nDan: I did not have to request it, they had it there.\n\nMerlin: I don't really care miss, I don't care if it's foam or it's feathers, but I would like, I would like three green apples and a blood soaked pillow.\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: I like a W.\n\nDan: That's part of my welcome kit, that's what I request, I send that out ahead.\n\nMerlin: That's disgusting.\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\rMerlin: One time we stayed at place in Boston and there were scuffs under the bed, filthy ladies' scuffs. And I don't know, for some reason, like filthy scuffs. Like that was, you know, I was looking forward to a little bit of history, some crazy roads. They were still doing the Big Dig.\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: And now we got ladies' scuffs.\n\nDan: I've found something disgusting in every hotel I've ever stayed in.\n\nMerlin: Scuffs are very personal. How about the whole bed? Like, you know, the thing is somebody is-\n\nDan: Beds in general are disgusting. If you really think about it.\n\nMerlin: A lot of traveling men are going to ruin that bed. Right. I would not, if you get, the thing is are you serious? You're putting a mint on that pillow and you want me to eat it? Why don't you just put it on the toilet paper fan. \r\rDan: (laughs)\r\rMerlin: Oh you're putting food on my bed. Thank you. Oh that's wonderful.\n\nDan: What do you think of room service then?\n\nMerlin: You don't really care about this Dan, why are you asking? Because I have so many opinions about all of this that you will regret bringing up any of this.\n\nDan: Why do you think so?\n\nMerlin: Because you'll regret it. Because you're opaque. I don't know, no, but see, now I had a good topic and I had cards and now we're talking about, about-\n\nDan: Well, let's go back to your cards, second card, top stack.\n\nMerlin: I hate it-\n\nDan: Notes for Merlin Mann.\n\nMerlin: When they do the fake "Do you mind if I come in the room?" Yes! I ordered room service, you can come in the room. But then they come in and they talk to you. So, the whole illusion of like this is your room and no one's ever been here before, is totally blown when they're in there talking about my food, they're lifting up the thing and they're talking about it. \n\nMerlin: You know what? I'm the one who ordered the food. I know what's under the little food-hat. If something else other than that is there, I will let you know, I do not need you to go "This is a barley corn steak with pepper corn side-gloink". Really? God that's so weird, because that's what I ordered. \r\rMerlin: And then here's the thing: Ask me how I order when I go in a hotel room?\n\nDan: How do you order when you go into a hotel room?\n \nMerlin: I say "Hi, this is room six-six-six. I would like to get some", you say, "in room dining", otherwise they get confused. You say, "I would like a large pitcher of ice water, not a glass, not two glasses. I would like a large pitcher of ice water, and a glass, and then I would like the ninety-dollar steak with the glacÃ© potatoes a-gratin". \n\nMerlin: I always open with the water, you literally cannot miss my order because I know you heard the water. I open with the water. How often do you imagine I get a pitcher of water?\n \nDan: How often? \n\nMerlin: Almost never. \n\nDan: Really?\n\nMerlin: And then you know what, now I'm the dick. Because now the guy comes up there he's got talk about my food. "May I come in?" Yes, you can come in. He comes in. And then I gotta go, "You know, that's a glass of water, covered with plastic." Oh, that helps. Oh, nothing bad could have happened to this, clearly. You put saran wrap on a glass. What could possibly go wrong? \n\nDan: Do you think they put the saran wrap on the glass to make you feel like it is cleaner, or do you think they do that in case in transit from the kitchen, or restaurant, to your room it could perhaps get bumped and they don't want it to spill? \n\nMerlin: Right, like a rat or a teamster falls down. I don't know. \r\rDan: (laughing) A rat.\r\rMerlin: I think it's part of this whole illusion of like high service. There's this book that just came out called Brand Washed. I got the sample from the iBooks, but I haven't read the whole book. But the guy was promoting it with this really interesting article focused on Whole Foods. \n\nMerlin: Which I've discussed on another- It's about grocery stores! I did it again. But it's basically about how Whole Foods does all this amazing stuff that you would never realize. \n\nDan: Yeah, it was great. \n\nMerlin: Did you read this? \n\nDan: Yeah, I did. Well, I didn't read the book, I read the article that you-\n\nMerlin: Right, with the flowers flowers by the front door.\n\nDan: Fresh cut flowers by the front door, you have the ice on everything that doesn't require ice.\n\nMerlin: What about the boxes? \n\nDan: You have boxes that are stacked up that are supposed to look like little crates, but in fact they are just hollow shells made out of cardboard. \n\nMerlin: They're fake, is what they are. \n\nDan: Or as you would say, "Fugazi". \n\nMerlin: Sure yeah. (shouting) "Fugazi".\r\rMerlin: Anyway. Ah, man! I had cards. \n\nDan: They call it over preparing-\r\rMerlin: No.\r\rDan: The cards.\n\nMerlin: It's, I just, I don't like fake service, right and that's why I feel-\r\rMerlin: You know what here's the problem: Either we feel like we can't say no, we feel like we shouldn't say no or we feel like we don't want to say no because we're good people and we like doing interesting things. \n\nMerlin: Right, to review. And then I think there's the three options. Let me look at this card. What were the three options? The three options are either you can not really say no, you can really say no, you can keep saying yes. Okay. So keep saying yes. Let's just move that out of the way, because I'm gonna take keep saying yes as not a great option.\n\nDan: Okay.\n\nMerlin: If you're here and you've made it through the hotel stuff, really consider about whether you can afford to keep saying yes. I think a lot of times when people get that cognitive dissonance, and they're turning this over in their head, I think a lot of times when they're saying, how do I say no? I think there should be some part of their heart that's saying like "Why can't I stop saying yes?".\r\rMerlin: It's not precisely so much that you're not saying no. It's more that you've developed this mania where that "yes" somehow just pops out of your mouth like a broken tooth, and like, all of a sudden now you've got more work, when you already had more work than you could do. \n\nMerlin: Right? Remember me talking about my old boss Richard and how he would say "All right, you want me to do this thing? Like go talk to these other people whose work that I'm doing and tell them you're bumping them." Right?\n\nDan: Yeah.\n\nMerlin: Obviously you can't do that unless you're as irreplacable as Richard was, but I would at least have that going through my head when you say yes to everything, because if you haven't vetted that person, if you haven't vetted that work. And that's why I think the other two options are a lot more sane. \n\nMerlin: Either not really saying no, or really saying no. And I have examples of that.\n\nDan: OK.\n\nMerlin: OK. God I'm like Syracusa now. I guess that's good. I love that guy. Hey, that was a great episode by the way. What was it about? Oh, it was about the Windows 8.\n\nDan: Yeah. You're talking about the most recent episode of Hypercritical.\n\nMerlin: Right. It was really good.\n\nDan: Episode number 34, "Pride in Craftsmanship". \n\nMerlin: Should put that in the nerdy thing. \r\rDan: It's in there. \n\nMerlin: Yeah. Oh, by the way, Windows 8; can we do a little bit of follow up on Windows 8?\n\nDan: Yeah, you're a big Windows user. \r\rMerlin: Well, you know, I have an opinion on it. I just literally don't care.\r\rMerlin: Ok. You can really say no. You can not really say no. And so here's what I think, when we have trouble saying no I think there are three things. I will never prepare for this show again, I promise. \r\rDan: OK. Good.\r\rMerlin: I think you either have not enough information, you have not enough context or you have not enough courage. \n\nMerlin: Right? So think about it, if you really knew whether something was a good idea, it would not be hard right? If somebody goes "Hey, can you spend the weekend literally stabbing yourself in the eye?" You wouldn't say I'll think about it or yes, you would go, "No, like I'm already going to Disney World and I can't do that". \n\nMerlin: Or like I'd just as soon not poke my own eyes out with knives like right, you don't have to vet that. Or if somebody goes, "Hey, do you want to go have a drink with George Clooney?" Like I'm going to feel ok about asking my wife, you know, "Can you take care of the Tater Tots tonight because I'm going to go hang with Clooney", or whatever. Right? \r\rMerlin: I mean, but that's the problem, those kinds of extreme cases are not most of what we deal with. We get tons of stuff that kind of sounds like something we can, should or ought, you know, ought to do for this person, do you know? But I know that's obvious but I just need to say that, even though it's obvious; is that if you're having trouble saying yes or no, you don't know what to say. \n\nMerlin: Or if your heart or your gut tells you that you probably shouldn't say yes to this, because you don't have the time, you don't have the, whatever, the interest, the expertise, the whatever. I think that's your brain trying to tell you something, you know what I mean? I think either you don't have enough information or you don't have enough context or, ultimately if you do say yes and didn't want to, you don't have enough courage. \n\nDan: I love that you're using the word courage. I think that's the first time I've heard you use that. \n\nMerlin: That's an awful word. \n\nDan: Why? \n\nMerlin: Well, it's so like-\n\nDan: I think it's a great word. \n\nMerlin: I don't know, I hear a choir of angels whenever you say that word, like it's some fancy thing. But like courage is this thing that you dig out of a pit of shame most of the time, I think. I think courage is not this thing where you walk around. I mean, that's the people who are full of crap, is the people who walk around acting all courageous and saying the right thing. \n\nMerlin: I think the real courage is to be somebody incredibly broken who occasionally pulls it out. Like, that's courage. Courage to me is somebody like who hits rock bottom and manages to go to AA. Like, that's courage. Like, just, you know, protecting your brand and trying to look good about everything doesn't take courage. \n\nMerlin: Like, it just takes a Facebook account. I think courage is a really interesting word, because it's- Each time that you're courageous about something, I think, for myself, I'm fighting like every impulse I have to not be courageous. So, courage to me is like almost like some kind of little seedling that comes out of this like dirt of embarrassment, you know? \n\nMerlin: (sound of cards being waved) But enough of that. So what, I think you know, enough information. Should I just put this away? \n\nDan: No. I don't like these cards.\n\nMerlin: No, it's stupid. \n\nMerlin: No, those are good cards. \n\nMerlin: If you had more information, you would know whether you should say yes or no.\n\nMerlin: Right. If you knew more about the project, like when is it due? Or, as I like to say it, like, what is it that I would be peculiarly good at, in helping you with this project?\n\nDan: Do you feel indecisive?\n\nMerlin: Mmm. Sorry. Not really.\n\nDan: No?\n\nMerlin: No, well I don't think so, do you think so?\n\nDan: Do I think you feel indecisive or do I feel indecisive?\n\nMerlin: You do not seem at all indecisive to me.\n\nDan: It depends on the thing. If it's a really big important decision it usually very, very easy for me to make it. If it's a small decision it can be more flummoxing. \n\nMerlin: It depends on whether I've eaten. Like a lot of times if I-\n\nDan: That's the gluten talking.\n\nMerlin: I know that's the gluten, it's the gluten not talking. Nobody's talking. That's the problem. They're just walking around looking at places, going, "nah, I don't want that." See, and then I don't eat and it gets worse. \r\rMerlin: (sighs) The glutens. \r\rMerlin: I don't know if I'm indecisive, I don't think so. I think, if anything, I'm way too decisive, because in my brain I make a terrible decision and stick with it until I have to back out of it. \n\nMerlin: I think that's probably what a lot of people, if they're honest, I think that's what a lot of people do. You know? There's something we've kind of hinted at before. I don't know if we've ever said it this bluntly, but, you know, just talking about the indecision, talking about the courage. When people go, "I don't need something like this junk you're talking about". \r\rMerlin: Like, "I'm never scared at work". Like, "I got it wired. I've been here for a 190 years, and I can pee whenever I feel like it." And it's like, well, maybe the reason you don't need to. Maybe the reason you're so courageous about your job is you don't have anything interesting to be scared of at your job, right? \n\nMerlin: Which is okay, but, like, don't look down your nose at somebody who wants something a little more robust in their life. Like, we're asking, in some ways we're asking for challenges to the thing that's comfortable to us with this stuff. So, I mean, if you're somebody who says, "Sorry, I literally have to say yes to everything." Well, then, like I say, I don't know how to help you. \n\nMerlin: I also don't know how you sleep. I would just be, you know, because again, think about the way a lot of stuff gets handed to you. Like if you were going to buy a house, like you have bought a house, but in the past. Like if somebody just came up to you and just said a number would you just go "yes." Well, no first of all you go, "is that number high enough for what I wanted." You know, there's all kinds of decisions that you would have to make just about the words that came out of that person's mouth. \n\nMerlin: You would never just say yes. Because why? Because you have to negotiate. You got to negotiate first of all, whether that number makes any sense. You gotta find out whether they've been approved for a loan. And then there's all kind of further stuff. You certainly, you've been through this, right, with your thing? It was ridiculous.\n\nDan: Negotiations.\n\nMerlin: Negotiations, but you don't feel like you're being a dick because you go, "well, can you tell me a little more about the air conditioning? That seems kind of weird." Right? Because you know what, once you sign on the line that is dotted, that is your air conditioning and your problem. If you accept the big crate of bananas and go, "thanks for the bananas." Like that's all yours now. And so, if somebody comes to you with a really crazy project and you just go yes, because that's your deal, you are now responsible-\n\nDan: Right.\n\nMerlin: For the sanity of that project's completion.\n\nDan: A contract. \n\nMerlin: It's a contract. (laughs)\r\rMerlin: Right? That, so that's the problem.\n\nDan: I love the Glengarry reference you dropped in there. \n\nMerlin: Mmm hmm.\r\rDan: We could just do a show just on that.\n\nSign on the Line that is Dotted. \n\nSuch a good movie. \n\nThe way he holds him up. Wanna check voices in here?\n\nYep.\n\nOh yeah. But if you had more information, right? Like just regular information, like information about that person. I don't know if it's been long enough to talk about any of this at all. But we mentioned before, deal with someone who was a little squirrely at one point. It sounds like you thought this, it was with your house stuff, like you thought this person was a little squirrely but it soon became apparent that they were really squirrely. \n\nYeah. I don't even think they knew how squirrely they were.\n\nThat's the press like Angelina Jolie, you know?\n\nAnd is that what it's like? \n\nYes, very much so.\n\nIt is true. That's who I was buying the house from.\n\nWere you?\n\nPotentially.\n\nThis is my human blood necklace room. But if you'd had more information earlier about that person, you might have ditched earlier. Right?\n\nYeah.\n\nMore information. Now, the reason I break out context from information is I'm just really interested in this idea of context. Not context in the GTD sense of, like, at phone call or whatever, but context in the sense of, like, I think to understand anything. You have to understand it in some kind of context. I've been rattling on a lot about scientific stuff and, you know what I mean, we talked last night I think on the show, we were talking about information in context. \n\nI think that was here but that's the problem. Like information on it's own, like one data point does not tell ya that much, two tells you something, but you really need three to see a trendline, and like eighteen would help a lot more. If any one of those one data points out of those eighteen, could seem to tell a story by itself, but when you put all 18 of those up, or for that matter, if you put 350 of them up, like you do some 5 year moving average thing, you're gonna see some, a completely different story. \n\nRight? It's like William Faulkner, like Sound of the Fury. Like, if you only read one chapter, you're only gonna hear one person's version of the story.\n\nRight, right.\n\nRush them on. Right? And so, I think the context part is going okay well I've got the information now. I understand that you have this due date. Right, now I want to understand is this a real date. I might go check that out. Do I know that you are the kind of squirrely person that kind of doesn't finish a lot of projects and then has lots of people end up mopping up at the last moment? \n\nRight? This is. You're just bringing lots of expertise and experience to bear. But if you're not sure whether or how to say anything but yes, I think you probably need more information and then you need information in context. I don't know if I'm putting that well.\n\nNo, you are. You are.\n\nThe context part, right? I mean, it's gotta be about more than just like a factoid. And for yourself, like, gosh, what could be more context than you going, "Oh my gosh, I already have so much stuff that is late" or "That is coming up due" or "That I feel like I've done kind of a half-assed job on." Right? \n\nYou get so much of that stuff, well. Anyway, not to beat a drum. But the other part is the courage part. Because if you have enough information and you have enough context, it's an implementation detail, which is if you know that you really don't want to stick knives in your eyes and you can put that in the context of, "I'd really rather go to Disney World," that's a really easy choice. \n\nRight? But our reluctance to ask for more information because we're not sure that's okay, our reluctance to take any information we have and put it in context with other things that we know, other things that are due. Accepting the scarcity and putting this alongside of it. I think that can make us very uncourageous, because it's just another thing I've gotta do now. \n\nYou know that feeling? It's like, oh great, here's another thing I've gotta do. And pretty soon it just becomes this undifferentiated pile. It is almost like a bunch of index cards. They all kind of look the same. But like, you know, how do you know which of those you should have accepted in the first place? \n\nWell, you're not allowed to think that because that's fancy, right? But I think that's why you're having trouble saying no. That's why you're having trouble saying anything but yes, and that is a distinction. So we're short on time. I think my answer to this for the "don't really say no" part is what I call the qualified yes, which is you can. So okay. So one more a distinction. \n\nI think there is stuff you really want to and should say yes to maybe, and then there is other stuff where you know you just shouldn't say yes to it. And I think for a lot of us that second kind, where like we really know, oh my God, I should not say yes. I should not say I will meet this person for coffee tomorrow, because I know I'm gonna have to cancel it. \n\nI already can feel then I'm gonna have to be that guy. Right? In my case, that would be a classic one for me. It's like, "Oh, sure, why not." And now, I've got to go make all that happen, and when it doesn't happen, I also now I'm the person that has to call them and say you know what I suck, I can't do this. \n\nAnd I do that constantly. I hate.\n\nWhat about saying no and feeling regret later. What about people who say no to rally or saying no without considering it enough.\n\nI think there's.\n\nYou want to go out with us tonight? Oh no, no, no. And that's the night you would have met your.\n\n I know. \n\nI could've seen, you don't listen to music, but there was an Elephant 6 showcase one night in 1998 where I could have seen Neutral Milk Hotel and The Minders and Olivia Tremor Control and all these bands that I really, really like a lot or especially used to like a lot a lot. And I just went and I don't know. \n\nAnd it became this legendary show in Tallahassee. I regret that. But I also know that there is an availability heuristic where you're gonna way over focus on the things you regret in all the times that you kind of blew it because you were worried about regret. Like, you've got to do something. Right? \n\nMake a choice and live with it. Like, that sucks. It's no fun. I'm terrible at it. But I'm just telling you that regret, what is regret good for? You don't get to cash that in. It's like Confederate scrip. You know, like regret is just this millstone that you're gonna have to carry around until you decide I don't really need this. \n\nI can't change what that thing was. Especially if you're just gonna let that affect your decision making all along, right? And again, this is that whole work culture thing we always talk about. Like, there's all this mythology about how we do things here. Right? And that delivery service screwed us one time in 1987, so now they're the devil to us. \n\nRight. \n\nOr. You know what I mean? \n\nYeah.\n\nOr like that one time we didn't have the birthday party on the fourth Friday, you know, and Jeannie got mad. Information context. And then the. But I think here's the problem, though, is between those two. Like, so you got the things that you want to kind of say yes to. And so to me, that's kind of maybe later. \n\nIf it's something that I really really want to do. If I actually want to do that. If I have the information, the context, and the courage, and I say, "Yeah. You know what, I want to do that thing with you. I would like to help you plan the Christmas party." Something as seemingly simple as that. Well first of all, planning a party is like shooting a bullet with a bullet. \n\nIt's really, really hard. But let's say you want to do that. And you go, "You know what, I would love that. Yes." I remember last year thinking I could improve this if I worked on this, so I'm going to just do this, and I'm going to help give you something where you are going to go, "You know what, that's really cool, I'd would like to do that." Have the information, the context, and the courage. \n\nI understand that I probably can't plan ten parties. I can't say yes to doing all of those, because some of them are probably going to suck and the people are going to be losers, and I don't really want to be involved in that, but I'm okay with this. \n\n \n\nBut here's the problem. Let's say you really, really don't want to be involved with planning and implementing the Christmas party. If you say, "kind of, maybe, and yes," to that, like you're a bonehead, because they hear that as "something, something, sure." Right? If you say that, because that's the implication, right? \n\nBecause if you say maybe about something, well what's maybe about it? Are you gonna do it? It's like a Yoda thing, right? You're either going to help with this or you're not. Do you know what I mean? \n\nI do.\n\nAnd I think that makes it complex for everybody, and it's also helping you build a really dumb muscle. Which is this, that maybe muscle. Well, if you really want to do that, why don't you write a note to yourself for November 1st of next year to recontact that person.\n\nWhy November 1st? Ah, cause it's plenty of time to plan for the party. They really fill up by the beginning of December. You got to plan early.\n\nOkay.\n\n Right, but, like, with me, if I say to somebody, like you know me right? Not that good of thing of a thing her,e but, like, for me if it's not on the calendar it doesn't exist.\n\nMm-hm.\n\nBut that's also true with stuff I say maybe to. Or sometimes somebody says, "Look we have a phone call." And I'm like, "Well, actually I can't do that this week," in principle I don't schedule calls in the same week that they're happening, but I will say, "Can you contact me in three weeks?" Or six weeks, or whatever, and I put it on my calendar and I remind myself. \n\nAnd you know what, if that comes up in three weeks or six weeks and I go, "Ugh, why did I say this?" that is a lesson for me. That is a lesson. I've got to quit saying maybe to things. I not only can't say yes to everything, I should stop saying maybe because that kind of makes a dick. Right? I not being honest.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'm not being honest. And so that makes it hard because now you've accumulated all these half-assed things with other people, you still don't really feel like you've got the power to say no, when you know in your heart, you really wanted and should have said no. And if didn't say no, well then, gosh, are you going to do a good job with it? \n\nRight, because if you just kind of say maybe to lots of stuff and that's your world.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike, how are you going to make anything great with that? That's the problem. \n\nThat's got to be the decision point then. Can you do a good job by saying yes? If you say yes, could you do a good job? If not, then you can't do it.\n\nWell, and email Dan with your examples of where saying yes to everyting turned out great. Like, you know what I mean. Like I would love\n\nYeah\n\nTo hear you tell me about examples of that, because I have a hard time believing that you've done 20 years of great work. I think you'll self-report that. I think you could self-report that. \n\nBut you're the same guy who sends the crappy emails. When I go and do the email talk at the company, you know who's not there? Like the guy in Porsche banging on his Blackberry while he's going on 280. Because you know why, that guy is great at email. Right? Email, multitasking and cunilingus. He's the king because he's never asked anybody else whether he was any good at it.\n\nRight.\n\nThey would line up, they would line up. People with like salves, with full inboxes. I said, "You know what, Johnny, dial it down." Anyway. I think you have to decide the things that you can afford to say no to. But you're kind of not allowed to be that stressed out if you do say yes unequivocally to everything. \n\nBecause if you care about everything, you care about nothing. That's not quite John Kane kind of stuff. It's just how it works. You care about some stuff, but you can't care about everything, otherwise it is literally, definition-wise, uniquely not care. It's something else. You know if you can't square the idea of saying yes to everything with why you're feeling overwhelmed and not shipping stuff that you love, well that's cognitive dissonance, like not something that will be solved with a new calendar and a pen. \n\nBoy, I talked a lot that one. \n\nNot like this one. \n\n \n\nNah, I talked a lot. \n\nNo, it was good.\n\nYeah, let's me see what else I've got here. I've got to buy tequila.\n\nLike more\n\nSchool tuition, unlimited, how to say no, Windows 8. I guess I covered everything.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat about, you feel OK about the Tiles? You feel good about the Tiles? You excited about the Tiles?\n\n That's the new band out of Seattle?\n \n\nRight, yeah, former members of Tadpole and Greece. \n\nDidn't they do that song, "Danger, Danger, High Voltage?"\n\nHmm. Oh, "High Voltage." \n\nYeah.\n\nI think that's AC/DC.\n\nOh, okay. That's when they got that new singer when the other one died.\n\nThat's right, that's Shania Twain.\n\n I think you're thinking of Beyonce, the pregnant Beyonce.\n \n\nI have never studied French. I asked my wife about this and like so many things she just completely ignored me. But I was in the bathroom and I noticed her name on the cover of a magazine, and now I can't stop thinking about her name, Beyonce. Because I would like to know what it means. Because, usually you get a name like Amy. \n\nAmy. Especially "AIMEE". I think that's a French-y version of "the one who is loved." Right, it's like a reflexive noun, or a reflexive verb, rather.\n\nSure.\n\nBut she is the one who has been Beyonce-d. I don't have a huge problem with this, but I've got a little problem with it and it's right there in La Croix, and I can't get it out at La Croix. I'm, I'm cross aid. \n\nIs that where that word comes from?\n\nA re-cross aid. Well, it's garlic, garlic, you know, want to button this up?\n \n\nYes, let's button it up.\n \n\nOkay, I love you.\n \n\nI love you too, Merlin Man. timecode.fps=30type=fileversion=1.1
